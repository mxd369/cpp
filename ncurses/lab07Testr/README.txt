those project is


NCurses

Text User Interface



Initially after researching I tried to write my own code to complete this project. This first approach has been my downfall for many projects. But I feel I am somehwat making progress I my personal programming development. but ncurses has a lot for a student to go through in a limited amount of time so I decided I should find an alternative method. In my web programming class I learned the best way to learn is to read the professors source code. It's a little scary at first but after practice reading source code normalizes. So I looked at source code for NCurses written by authors and played around with code snippets.


Everything is abstracted, for example: Write a C++ program that displays the contents of a file in curses mode. Not knowing what to do, it seems difficult but afterwards, the description solved the problem. Programming is actually quite simple, but it requires hypthesizing, testing, and practice.

Supa Mike made a program read.cpp. On Wednesday I decided to download it and run it. It pretty much did most of what the lab tasked us to do. I could just take that source code, wrap it inside ncurses,  and set the dimensions of the screen, scrolling functionality.

So I listen to programmers talk a lot and I know game programmers get code to write to the screen, and the computer writes or renders, and it renders at frame rates, many times per second, this reminded me of how prefresh works. When I drag the terminal and it closes the program, prefresh can handle that.


So in summary I learned to read source code and don't reinvent the wheel.

I am feeling more confident than I felt in previous labs.


My premise about programming has been flawed.

its somewhat about process and somewhat about pathfinding
