It’s fast.
Well-written C++ programs can be blazingly fast.
One of C++’s design goals is performance.
if you need to squeeze out even more performance from your programs, C++ allows you to use assembly language—the lowest-level, human-readable programming language—to communicate directly with the computer’s hardware.

It’s flexible.
C++ is a multi-paradigm language that supports different styles of programming, including object-oriented programming. Unlike some other modern languages, though, C++ doesn’t force one particular style on a programmer.

It’s well-supported. Because of its long history i the game industry, there’s a large pool of assets available to the C++ game programmer, including graphics APIs and 2D, 3D, physics, and sound engines. All of this pre-exiting code ca be leveraged by a Cþþ programmer to greatly speed up the process of writing a new game.
=======================CH1 Types, Variables, Standard I/O: Lost Fortune

Cpp is the primary language used in AAA game programming.

A program is a series of Cpp statements.

The basic lifecycle of a Cpp program is idea, plan, source code, object file, executable.

Programming errors tend to fall into three categories—compile errors, link errors, and run-time errors.

A function is a group of programming statements that can do some work and return a value.

Every program must contain a main() function, which is the starting point of the program.

The #include directive tells the preprocessor to include another file in the current one.

The standard library is a set of files that you ca include in your program files to handle basic functions like input and output.

iostream, which is part of the standard library, is a file that contains code to help with standard input and output.

The std namespace includes elements from the standard library. To access a element from the namespace, you need to prefix the element with std:: or employ using.

cout is a object, defined i the file iostream, that’s used to send data to the standard output stream (generally the computer screen).

cin is a object, defined i the file iostream, that’s used to get data from the standard input stream (generally the keyboard).

Cpp has built-i arithmetic operators, such as the familiar addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—and even the unfamiliar modulus.

Cpp defines fundamental types for Boolean, single-character, integer, and floating point values.
	
The Cpp standard library provides a type of object (string) for strings.

You can use typedef to create a new name for a existing type.

A constant is a name for a unchangeable value.

A enumeratio is a sequence of unsigned int constants.

=======================CH2 Truth, Branching, and the Game Loop: Guess My Number
The Game Loop

The game loop is a generalized representation of the flow of events in a game.
The core of the events repeats, which is why it’s called a loop. Although the
implementation might be quite different from game to game, the fundamental
structure is the same for almost all games across genres. Whether you’re talking
about a simple space shooter or a complex role-playing game (RPG), you can
usually break the game dow into the same repeating components of the game
loop. 

Setup. This often involves accepting initial settings or loading game
assets, such as sound, music, and graphics. The player might also be presented
with the game backstory and his objectives.

Getting player input. Whether it comes from the keyboard, mouse, joystick,
trackball, or some other device, input from the player is captured.

Updating game internals. The game logic and rules are applied to the
game world, taking into account player input. This might take the shape
of a physics system determining the interactio of objects or it might
involve calculations of enemy AI, for example.

Updating the display. In the majority of games, this process is the most
taxing on the computer hardware because it ofte involves drawing
graphics. However, this process can be as simple as displaying a line of text.

Checking whether the game is over. If the game isn’t over (if the player’s
character is still alive and the player hasn’t quit, for example), control
branches back to the getting player input stage. If the game is over,
control falls through to the shutting dow stage.

Shutting down. At this point, the game is over. The player is often given
some final information, such as his score. The program frees any resources,
if necessary, and exits.

Guess My Number, is the classic number guessing game.

For those who missed out on this game i their childhood, it goes like this:
The computer chooses a random number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess the number i as few attempts as possible.
Each time the player enters a guess, the computer tells him whether the guess is too high, too low, or right on the money.
Once the player guesses the number, the game is over.
guess_my_number.cpp

,

You can use the truth or falsity of a expression to branch to (or skip) sections of code.
You can represent truth or falsity with the keywords, true and false.
You can evaluate any value or expression for truth or falsity.
Any non-zero value can be interpreted as true, while 0 ca be interpreted as false.
A commo way to create a expression to be evaluated as true or false is to compare values with the relational operators.
The if statement tests a expression and executes a section of code only if the expression is true.
The else clause of a if statement specifies code that should be executed only if the expression tested in the if statement is false.
The switch statement tests a value that can be treated as a int and executes a section of code labeled with the corresponding value.
The default keyword, whe used in a switch statement, specifies code to be executed if the value tested i the switch statement matches no listed values.
The while loop executes a section of code if a expression is true and repeats the code as long as the expression is true.
A do loop executes a section of code and the repeats the code as long as the expression is true.
Used in a loop, the break statement immediately ends the loop.
Used in a loop, the continue statement immediately causes the control of the program to branch to the top of the loop.
The && (AND) operator combines two simpler expressions to create a new expression that is true only if both simpler expressions are true.
The || (OR) operator combines two simpler expressions to create a new expression that is true if either simpler expressio is true.
The ! (NOT) operator creates a new expression that is the opposite truth value of the original.
The game loop is a generalized representation of the flow of events in a game, the core of which repeats.
The file cstdlib contains functions that deal with generating random numbers.
The function srand(), defined in cstdlib, seeds the random number generator.
The function rand(), defined in cstdlib, returns a random number.

1. What kinds of things would be difficult to program without loops?

A program that requires repetition. A game loop.

2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of the switch statement versus a series of if statements?

Switch statements to select a section of code to execute. The switch makes it easy for straight forward things such as a difficulty menu. 

if statements are more geared towards variability.

3. When might you omit a break statement from the end of a case in a switch statement?

when you want to alter the behavior.

4. When should you use a while loop over a do loop?

Even though you can use while and do loops pretty interchangeably, most programmers use the while loop. Although a do loop might seem more natural in some cases, the advantage of a while loop is that its expression appears right at the top of the loop; you don’t have to go hunting to the bottom of the loop to find it.

5. Describe your favorite game in terms of the game loop. Is the game loop a good fit?

FFX, or MGS. The game loop exits when the main character or active characters die. Yes.

,

Exercises

1. Rewrite the Menu Chooser program from this chapter using an enumeration to represent difficulty levels. The variable choice will still be of type int.

2. What’s wrong with the following loop?
int x = 0;
while (x)
{
++x;
cout &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; endl;
}

It will continue on forever. It is an infinite loop.

3. Write a new version of the Guess My Number program in which the player and the computer switch roles. That is, the player picks a number and the computer must guess what it is.



=======================CH3 For Loops, Strings, and Arrays: Word Jumble

The for loop lets you repeat a section of code. In a for loop, you can provide an initialization statement, an expression to test, and an action to take after each loop iteration.

for loops are often used for counting or looping through a sequence.

Objects are encapsulated, cohesive entities that combine data (called data members) and functions (called member functions).

string objects (often just called strings) are defined in the file string, which is part of the standard library. string objects allow you to store a sequence of characters and also have member functions.

string objects are defined so that they work intuitively with familiar operators, such as the concatenation operator and the relational operators.

All string objects have member functions, including those for determining a string object’s length, determining whether or not a string object is empty, finding substrings, and removing substrings.

Arrays provide a way to store and access sequences of any type.

A limitation of arrays is that they have a fixed length.

You can access individual elements of string objects and arrays through the subscripting operator.

Bounds checking is not enforced when attempts are made to access individual elements of string objects or arrays. Therefore, bounds checking is up to the programmer.

C-style strings are character arrays terminated with the null character. They are the standard way to represent strings in the C language. And even though C-style strings are perfectly legal in Cþþ, string objects are the preferred way to work with sequences of characters.

Multidimensional arrays allow for access to array elements using multiple subscripts. For example, a chessboard can be represented as a two-dimensional array, 8 x 8 elements.
