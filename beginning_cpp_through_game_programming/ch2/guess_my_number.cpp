// Guess My Number
// The classic number guessing game

/*
Guess My Number, is the classic number guessing game:
For those who missed out on this game in their childhood, it goes like this:
The computer chooses a random number between 1 and 100,
and the player tries to guess the number in as few attempts as possible.
Each time the player enters a guess,
the computer tells him whether the guess is too high,
too low,
or right on the money.
Once the player guesses the number,
the game is over.
