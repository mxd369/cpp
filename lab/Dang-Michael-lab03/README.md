Major Thought:
Is solving problem sets going to make me a better software engineer?

What I learned:
I started the lab as early as possible but still ran out of time.
I learned that I need to start reading code to learn how to write better code.
Before, I learned doing the end of chapter exercises, but this is not enough.
Since I am very weak with programming I struggled tremendously.
I spent over 16 hours, missed the first deadline and the second turn in time.
So I already have a 40% deducation.
I now know I need to add more time to work on these problems.
For example if I think it will take be 8 hours to complete an assignment
I would multiply that estimation by 4.
I find c++ to be such a complex language, not syntactically but because
the language has so many different caveats.

exclusive.cpp
This was the most difficult problem for me. I could not get the code down.
I realized eventually I would need a double loop but the "do not use strings"
really messed with my psyche. All the string manipulation practice I had prior
was hindering me from finding a new solution to this problem. I am accustomed
to using python and all the string functions that I could not block. I worked
on this problem for 9 days. I still need to practice using double loops to
extract values. I thought I should work on this problem until completion before
trying the other problems and made a huge mistake. Next time I need to work on
all problems equally. I need to understand nested loops better.

primesum.cpp
This problem had so many ways to get it right I was overwhelmed with making a
decision on what to use. Another psychological problem I face, in industry
they call it analysis paralysis. I read in a book that if the code exists its
wise to use it an modify it. I research the sieve of erosthoeses and different
prime algorithms but I made a mistake by not utilizing square root to improve
the speed of this problem. I will go back to try to implement a more performant
solution.

armstrong.cpp
This problem was not as difficult as the other problems but I needed help from
piazza. If people did not ask questions about this problem I would have made
more mistakes.

bitsum.cpp
I have a pre-existing fear of bits because I failed the lab01 and lab02 which
had bit problems. I just don't get bits coming from a python background. I
decided I should learn more about bit manipulation and implement code with c
and c++ to get over this fear. Bit some was not difficult because I looked on
piazza which gave many clues on how to solve the problem.

endtime.cpp
This problem was also difficult because part of me thought I should do some
string or char manipulation. Part of me thought stringstream could be used
but I knew the problem was easier than it was in my head. I watched youtube
videos on the 0000-2400 clock vs the 12:00 AM - 12:00 PM clock. The 0000
part of the problem was not easy to solve.

Summary:
I can not underestimate problem sets. I need to multiply completion estimation
by 4. I need to skip a problem that I do not understand and spread my thinking
on the other problems equally. I realize that computer science knows no time
limit. It can take huge amounts of time to get solutions that are performant.
There are large amounts of ways to solve a problem, but it takes a great amount
of thought to come up with a solution that is fast and clever. I believe it
will take me years to get comfortable with the basics. I should study design
patterns and data structures now to create a better foundation. I need to study
more problem solving mathematics. Now I know why computer scientists are bald,
out of shape, have grey hair at an early age, bags under their eyes, and can
be easily agitated.
