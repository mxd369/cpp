/*
numbers.cpp:
Write a program that prints out the binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal representation (respectively) of all unsigned shorts (in order). If the number is divisible by 3, then also print “Go”. If the number is divisible by 5, then also print “GOGOGO”. Otherwise, “S” should also be printed. Below is a sample of some of the entries near the middle:

  0b1010'0000'0000'0000 0120000 40960 0xa000 GOGOGO
  0b1010'0000'0000'0001 0120001 40961 0xa001 S
  0b1010'0000'0000'0010 0120002 40962 0xa002 Go
  0b1010'0000'0000'0011 0120003 40963 0xa003 S
  0b1010'0000'0000'0100 0120004 40964 0xa004 S
  0b1010'0000'0000'0101 0120005 40965 0xa005 GOGOGOGO
