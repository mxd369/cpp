/*
endtime.cpp:

Write a program to read two integers with the following significance.
The first integer value represents a time of day on a 24 hour clock, so that 1245 represents quarter to one mid-day, for example.

The second integer represents a time duration in a similar way, so that 345 represents three hours and 45 minutes.

This duration is to be added to the first time, and the result printed out in the same notation, in this case 1630 which is the time 3 hours and 45 minutes after 12.45.

Enter in a start time: 1415
Enter in a duration: 50
End time is: 1505
