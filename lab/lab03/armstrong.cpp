/*
armstrong.cpp:

Write a program that prints out all Armstrong numbers, each on their own line.
An Armstrong number is a three digit integer such that the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself.
For example, 371 is an Armstrong number since 3^3 + 7^3 + 1^3 = 371.
Remember, you do not need nor should you use an array to solve this problem.
