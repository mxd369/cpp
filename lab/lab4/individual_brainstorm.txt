This lab will exericise many skills, and requires working thouhght the Breakoutlab sheet.

Making Assumptions:
  1.
    requires writing code that outputs the size of the types listed.
  2.
    requires conversion
  3.
    Would need to type the program and run it.

Warmup Activity
  Requires an understanding of variables, pointers and memory.

Arrays and Pointers Activity
  Requires pointer and array

Functions, Pointers, and Tricky Declarations Activity

I feel this lab will help with the first project.
