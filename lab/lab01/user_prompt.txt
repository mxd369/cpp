user prompt
I don't see when the user would be using getValue or why the number needs to have a variable to reference it. what am I missing?
 
-Pick a number (1,2,4,8,16,32)
*user picks a number or is told there input was invalid and repeat the step*
-Pick a number between 0 and 2^n - 1 (n being dependent on K)
*user picks a number or is told their input was invalid and repeat the step*
-At what index do you want to place this?
*user picks index*
*repeated k times*
-what would you like to call this?
*user picks a String*

===========================

In the way you have described there is no way to verify if the int contains the values at the indices. Your program should list each index and its contents after the user stores values. In order to do that you need a method to get the values.

Edit* Also for this lab you may assume valid input. You don't have to worry about error checking yet.
