Postscript

From a philosophical point of view, you can now do everything that can be done using a computer — the rest is details! Among other things, this shows the value of “details” and the importance of practical skills, because clearly you have barely started as a programmer. But we are serious. The tools presented in this chapter do allow you to express every computation: you have as many variables (including vectors and strings) as you want, you have arithmetic and comparisons, and you have selection and iteration. Every computation can be expressed using those primitives. You have text and numeric input and output, and every input or output can be expressed as text (even graphics). You can even organize your computations as sets of named functions. What is left for you to do is “just” to learn to write good programs, that is, to write programs that are correct, maintainable, and reasonably efficient. Importantly, you must try to learn to do so with a reasonable amount of effort.
