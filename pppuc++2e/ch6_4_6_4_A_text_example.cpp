We didn’t present the temperature example because we were particularly interested in temperatures. Many people — such as meteorologists, agronomists, and oceanographers — are very interested in temperature data and values based on it, such as means and medians. However, we are not.

It is fair to say that whatever you are interested in, if you need to analyze data, you’ll use vector (or a similar data structure; see Chapter 21). As an example, let’s build a simple dictionary:
