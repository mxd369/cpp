p.239 10. INPUT and OUTPUT Streams


cout << "Please enter input file name: ";

string iname;

cin >> iname;

// The test of !ist checks if the file was properly opened.
if (!st) error("can't open input file",iname);

Data source:
input device -> device driver -> input library -> our program -> 
Data destination:
-> output library -> device driver -> output device


standard library
	iostream library
		standard istream = cin
		standard ostream = cout

ostream:
	turns values of various types into character sequences
	sends those characters "somewhere" (console, file, main memory, another comp)

values of various types		 character sequences
'c'      \
(12,34)  -> ostream          "Somewhere"
123      /          \        /
                     > Buffer


Buffer = data structure that the ostrea, uses internally to store the data you give it while communicating with the os.


istream:
	turns character sequences into values of various types
	gets those characters from somewhere (console, file, main memory, another comp)

values of various types		 character sequences
'c'      \
(12,34)  <- ostream <        "Somewhere"
123      /           \      /
                      Buffer
