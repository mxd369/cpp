<p>C++ Programming Principles and Practice</p>
<p>How to develop software</p>
<p>Well-designed code: correct, reliable and maintainable system</p>
<p>software construction and maimenance (if your aim is to become a programmer
or a software engineer)</p>
<p>Consider programming itself a form of problem solving: only through complete understanding of a problem and its solution can you express a correct program for it, and only through constructing and testing a program can you be certain that your understanding is complete.</p>
<p>A crucial tool for making a positive contribution to the world.</p>
<p>teaching philosophy and general approach, have a look at Chapter 0 (,'Notes to the Reader") .</p>

<h4>Read A professional-level general textbook (Stroustrup: The C++ Programming Language)</h4>
<pre>Philosophy of teaching and learning
* Program organization
* Debugging and testing
* Class design
* Computation
* Function and algorithm design
* Graphics (two-dimensional only)
* Graphical user interface (GUIs)
* Text manipulation
* Regular expression matching
* File and stream input and output(I/O)
* Memory management
* Scientific/numerical/engineering calculations
* Design and programming ideals
* The C++ standard library
* Software development strategies
* C-Language programming techniques

<hr>
<p>Portibility</p>
<pre>compile, link, and execute a simple program consisting of two source files:
my_file.cpp
my_file.cpp
using the GNU C++ compiler(g++) on a Unix or Linux machine

g++ -o my_program my_file.cpp my_file.cpp
my_program
</pre>

<p>Applications of C++ www.research.att/~bs/applications.html</p>
<p>Analysis: Whats the problem? What does the user want? What does the user need? What can the user afford? What kind of reliability do we need?</p>
<p>Design: How do we solve the problem? What should be the overall structure of the system? Which parts does it consist of? How do those parts communicate with each other? How does the system communicate with its users?</p>
<p>Programming: Express the solution to the problem (the design) in code. Write the code in a way that meets all constraints (time, space, money, reliability, and so on). Mkae sure that the code is correct and maintianable</p>
<p>Testing: Make sure the system works correctly under all circumstances required by systematically trying it out</p>
