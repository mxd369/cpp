/*
11.
Write a program that prompts the user to enter some number of
pennies (1-cent coins),
nickels (5-cent coins),
dimes (1O-cent coins),
quarters (25-cent coins),
half dollars (50-cem coins),
and one-dollar coins (1OO-cent coins).
Query the user separately for the number of each size coin, e.g.,
"How many pennies do you have?"
Then your program should print out something like this:
You have 23 pennies.
You have 17 nickels.
You have 14 dimes.
You have 7 quarters.
You have 3 half dollars.
The value of all of your coins is 573 cents.
You may have to use your imagination to get the numbers to add up right-justified,
but try; it can be done.
Make some improvements: if only one of a coin is reported,
make the output grammatically correct, e.g., " 14 dimes" and "1 dime" (not "1 dimes").
Also, report the sum in dollars and cents, i.e., $5.73 instead of 573 cents.
