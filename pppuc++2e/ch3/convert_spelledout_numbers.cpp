/*
9. Write a program that converts spelledÂ·out numbers such as "zero" and "two" into digits,
such as 0 and 2. When the user inputs a number,
the program should print out the corresponding digit.
Do it for the values 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 and write out
"not a number I know" if the user enters something that doesn't correspond,
such as "stupid computer!"
