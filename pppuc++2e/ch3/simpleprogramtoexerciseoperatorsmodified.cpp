/*
Get this little program to run. Then, modify it to read an int rather than a
double.

Note that sqrt() is not defined for an int so assign n to a double and
take sqrt() of that.

Also, "exercise" some other operations. Note that for ints /
is integer division and % is remainder (modulo), so that 512 is 2 (and not 2.5
or 3) and 5%2 is 1.

The definitions of integer *,/, and % guarantee that for
two positive ints a and b we have a/b • b + a%b == a
