/*
10. Write a program that takes an operation followed by two operands
and outputs the result.
For example:
+ 100 3.14
â€¢ 45

Read the operation into a string called operation and use an if-statement
to figure out which
operation the user wants, for example, if (operation=="+").
Read the operands into variables of type double.
Implement this for operations called +, - , *, /, plus , minus, mul,
and div with their obvious meanings.
