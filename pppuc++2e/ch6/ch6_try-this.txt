Try This:
Write a program that “bleeps” out words that you don’t like; that is, you read in words using cin and print them again on cout. If a word is among a few you have defined, you write out BLEEP instead of that word. Start with one “disliked word” such as 

	string disliked = “Broccoli”;

When that works, add a few more.
