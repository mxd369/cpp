So far we have talked about programming, code, and tools (such as compilers). Now you have to get a program to run. This is a crucial point in this book and in learning to program. This is where you start to develop practical skills and good programming habits. The exercises for this chapter are focused on getting you acquainted with your software development environment. Once you get the “Hello, World!” program to run, you will have passed the first major milestone as a programmer.

The purpose of a drill is to establish or reinforce your practical programming skills and give you experience with programming environment tools. Typically, a drill is a sequence of modifications to a single program, “growing” it from something completely trivial to something that might be a useful part of a real program. A traditional set of exercises is designed to test your initiative, cleverness, or inventiveness. In contrast, a drill requires little invention from you. Typically, sequencing is crucial, and each individual step should be easy (or even trivial). Please don’t try to be clever and skip steps; on average that will slow you down or even confuse you.

You might think you understand everything you read and everything your Mentor or instructor told you, but repetition and practice are necessary to develop programming skills. In this regard, programming is like athletics, music, dance, or any skillbased craft. Imagine people trying to compete in any of those fields without regular practice. You know how well they would perform. Constant practice — for professionals that means lifelong constant practice — is the only way to develop and maintain a high-level practical skill.

So, never skip the drills, no matter how tempted you are; they are essential to the learning process. Just start with the first step and proceed, testing each step as you go to make sure you are doing it right.
