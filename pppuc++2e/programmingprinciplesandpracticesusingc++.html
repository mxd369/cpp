<p>Analysis: Whats the problem? What does the user want? What does the user need? What can the user afford? What kind of reliability do we need?</p>
<p>Design: How do we solve the problem? What should be the overall structure of the system? Which parts does it consist of? How do those parts communicate with each other? How does the system communicate with its users?</p>
<p>Programming: Express the solution to the problem (the design) in code. Write the code in a way that meets all constraints (time, space, money, reliability, and so on). Mkae sure that the code is correct and maintianable</p>
<p>Testing: Make sure the system works correctly under all circumstances required by systematically trying it out</p>

<p>Review</p>
<pre>1. What is the purpose of the "Hello, World!" Program?
2. Name the four parts of a function.
3. Name a function that must appear in every C++ program
4. In the "Hello, World" program, what is the purpose of the line return 0;?
5. What is the purpose of the compiler?
6. What is the purpose of the #include directive?
7. What does a .h suffix at the end of a file signify in C++?
8. What does the linker do for your program?
9. What is the difference between a source file and an object file?
10. What is an IDE and what does it do for you?
11. If you understand everything in the textbook, why is it necessary to
practice?

1. To understand out to output a string and the minimal basics of a C++ program
2. four parts:
return type,
name,
parameter list,
function body.
3. main 
4. return value, to indicate that the program terminated successfully
5. translates source code to an executable(aka object code or machine code)
6. To make available ("To include facilities from a file")
7. .h is called a header or a header file. A header contains definition of terms, such as cout
8. links together the separate parts to form an executable program
9. object file can be read by the machine and the source file can be read by the programmer
10. will compile and link in a simplistic way versus issuing the compile and link commands manually in the command line window
11. reinforce terminology, design and development patterns, increase knowledge, improve skills by following exercises.

Hello, programming!

Here we go!
</pre>
<pre>2. Expanding on what you have learned, write a program that lists the instructions for a computer to find the upstairs bathroom, discussed in ยง2. 1. Can you think of any more steps that a person would assume, but that a computer would not? Add them to your list. This is a good start in "thinking like a computer." Warning: For most people, "go to the bathroom" is a perfectly adequate instruction. For someone with no experience with houses or bathrooms (imagine a stone-age person, somehow transported into your dining room) the list of necessary instructions could be very long. Plcase don't use more than a page. For the benefit of
the reader, you may add a short description of the layout of thc house you are imagining.</pre>
<pre>myprogram: 
</pre>
<pre>3. Write a description of how to get from the from door of your dorm room, apartment, house, whatever, to the door of your classroom (assuming you are attending some school; if you are not, pick another target). Have a friend try to follow the instructions and annotate them with improvements as he or she goes along. To keep friends, it may be a good idea to
"field lest" those instructions before giving them to a friend .</pre>
<pre>myprogram:
</pre>
<pre>4. Find a good cookbook. Read the instmctions for baking blueberry muffins (if you are in a country where "blueberry muffins" is a strange, exotic dish, usc a more familiar dish instead). Please note that with a bit of help and instruction, most of the people in the world can bake delicious blueberry muffins. It is not considered advanced or difficuh fine cooking. However, for the author, few exercises in this book arc as difficult as this one. It is amazing what you can do with a bit of practice.

* Rewrite those instmctions so that each individual action is in its own numbered paragraph. Be careful to list all ingredients and aU kitchen utensils used at each step. Be careful about crucial details, such as the desired oven temperature, preheating the oven, the preparation of the baking sheet, the way to time the cooking, and the need to protect your hands when removing the muffins from the oven.

* Consider those instructions from the point of view of a cooking
novice (if you are not one, get help from a friend who does not know
how to cook). Fill in the steps that the book's author (almost certainly an experienced cook) left out for being obvious.

* Build a glossary of terms used. (what's a muffin pan? What does
preheat do? What do you mean by "oven"?)

* Now bake some muffins and enjoy your results.</pre>
<pre>myprogram:
</pre>
<pre>5. Write a definition for each of the terms from "Terms." First try to see if you
can do it without looking at the chapter (not likely), then look through the
chapter to ftnd definitions. You might find the difference between your first
attempt and the book's version interesting. You might consult some suitable
online glossary, such as www.research.att.com/~bs/glossary.html. By
writing your own definition before looking it up, you reinforce the learning
you achieved through your reading. If you have to reread a section to form
a definition, that just helps you to understand. Feel free to use your own
words for the definitions, and make the definitions as detailed as you think
reasonable. Often, an example after the main in definition will be helpful. You
may like to store the definitions in a file so them you can add to them from
the "Terms" sections of later chapters.</pre>
<pre>myprogram:
</pre>
<p>Postscript: Get acquainted with the basic tools of programming. first learn the basics of our tool with a trivial program, later learn about more complicated programs without being distracted by our tools. Learning the tools and the language simultaneously is far harder than doing first one and then the other. This simplifying approach to learning a complex task by breaking it into a series of small and more manageable steps is useful</p>

<h3>Chatper 3: Objects, Types, and Values</h3>
<h4>"Fortune favors the prepared mind." - Louis Pasteur</h4>
<pre>fundamental notions of objects, types, values, and variables
introduce several operators:
char
int
double
string

key points:
Input
Variables
Input and type
Operations and operators
Assignment and initlaization
Composite assignment operators
  An example: count repeated words
Names
Types and objects
Type safety
  Safe conversions
  Unsafe conversions
</pre>

<p>Reading input: real programs produce results based on some input we give them (inputs from user)</p>
<p>Object a place (somewhere in the computers memory to place what we read)</p>
<p>Object is a region of memory with a type that specifies what kind of information can be placed in it</p>
<p>A named object is called a variable</p>
<p>Example: character strings are put into string variables and integers are out into int variables</p>
<p>Example: object of type int named age containing the integer value 42</p>

<p>Prompt: a message that prompts the user to take an action</p>
<p>Reading input from the keyboard into the variable(store the input into the variable)</p>
<p>A statement that introduces a new name into a program and sets aside memory for a variable is called a definition</p>
<pre>cin &lt;&lt;first_name; // read characters into a name</pre>
<p>Repetition provides opportunity for errors</p>
<p>Variables</p>
<p>The "places" in which we store data are called objects.</p>
<p>A named object is called a variabl and has a specific type (such as int or string)</p>
<p>A statement that defines a variable is called a definition, and a definition can and usually should provide an initial value.</p>
<pre>
string name = "Annemarie";
int number_of_steps = 39;

string name2 = 39;                 //error: 39 isn't a string
int number_of_steps = "Annemarie"; //error: "Anniemarie" is not an int

here are 5 types:
1) int for integers
2) double for floating-point numbers (double percision floating point)
3) char for individual characters
4) string for character strings
5) bool for logical variables

1) 39           // int: an integer
2) 3.5          // double: a floating-point number
3) '.'          // char: an individual character enclosed in single quotes
4) "Annemarie"  // string: a sequence of characters delimited by double quotes
5) true         // bool: true or false

<p><b>3.8 Types and objects</b></p>
<pre>A type defines a set of possible values and a set of operations(for an object).
An object is some memory that holds a value of a given type.
A value is a set of bits in memory that holds a value of a given type.
A variable is a named object.
A declaration is a statement that gives a name to an object.
A definition is a declaration that sets aside memory for an object.

<p><b>Drill</b></p>
<pre>After each step of this drill, run your program to make sure it is really doing what you expect it to. Keep a list or what mistakes you make so you can try to avoid those in the future.

1. This drill is to write a program that produces a simple form letter based on user input. Begin by typing the code from ยง3.1 prompting a user to enter his or her first name and writing "Hello, first_name" where first_name is the name entered by the user. Then modify your code as follows: change the prompt to "Enter the name or the person you want to write to" and change the output to "Dear first_name,". Don't forget the comma.

simpleformletter.cpp
#include iostream
#include string
#include vector
#include algorithm
#include cmath
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    cout&lt;&lt;"please enter your first name to be address in a letter\n";
	string first_name;
	cin&gt;&gt;first_name;
	cout&lt;&lt;"Dear, "&lt;&lt;first_name&lt;&lt;'\n';
}

2. Add an introductory line or two, like "How are you? I am fine. I miss you." Be sure to indent the first line. Add a few more lines of your choosing - it's your letter.

simpleformletter.cpp
#include iostream
#include string
#include vector
#include algorithm
#include cmath
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    cout&lt;&lt;"please enter your first name followed by (enter)\n";
	string first_name;
	cin&gt;&gt;first_name;
	cout&lt;&lt;"Dear, "&lt;&lt;first_name&lt;&lt;'\n';
	cout&lt;&lt;"    How are you? I am fine. I miss you "&lt;&lt;first_name+"."&lt;&lt;'\n';
}

3. Now prompt the user for the name or another friend, and store it in friend_name. Add a line to your letter: "Have you seen friend_name lately?"

simpleformletter.cpp
#include iostream
#include string
#include vector
#include algorithm
#include cmath
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    cout&lt;&lt;"Please enter your first name followed by (enter)\n";
	string first_name;
	cin&gt;&gt;first_name;
	cout&lt;&lt;"Dear, "&lt;&lt;first_name&lt;&lt;'\n';
	cout&lt;&lt;"    How are you? I am fine. I miss you "&lt;&lt;first_name+"."&lt;&lt;'\n';
	cout&lt;&lt;"Please enter the name of our friend followed by (enter)\n";
	string friend_name;
	cin>>friend_name;
	cout&lt;&lt;"Have you seen "&lt;&lt;friend_name&lt;&lt;" lately?\n";
}

4. Declare a char variable called friend_sex and initialize its value to O. Prompt the user to enter an m if the friend is male and an f if the friend is female. Assign the value entered to the variable friend_sex. Then use two if-statements to write the following: If the friend is male, write "If you see friend_name please ask him to call me." If the friend is female, write "If you see friend_name please ask her to call me."

simpleformletter.cpp
#include iostream
#include string
#include vector
#include algorithm
#include cmath
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    cout&lt;&lt;"Please enter your first name to be addressed in a formal letter followed by (enter)\n";
	string first_name;
	cin&gt;&gt;first_name;
	cout&lt;&lt;"Dear, "&lt;&lt;first_name&lt;&lt;'\n';
	cout&lt;&lt;"    How are you? I am fine. I miss you "&lt;&lt;first_name+"."&lt;&lt;'\n';
	cout&lt;&lt;"Please enter the name of our friend followed by (enter)\n";
	string friend_name;
	cin>>friend_name;
	cout&lt;&lt;"Have you seen "&lt;&lt;friend_name&lt;&lt;" lately?\n";
	char friend_sex = 0;
	cout&lt;&lt;"Please enter an m if "&lt;&lt;friend_name&lt;&lt;" is a male and an f if "&lt;&lt;friend_name&lt;&lt;" a female\n";
	cin>>friend_sex;
	if(friend_sex == 'm')
	{
		cout&lt;&lt;"If you see "&lt;&lt;friend_name&lt;&lt;" please as him to call me\n";
	}
	else if (friend_sex == 'f')
	{
		cout&lt;&lt;"If you see "&lt;&lt;friend_name&lt;&lt;" please as her to call me\n";
	}
	
}

5. Prompt the user to enter the age of the recipient and assign it to an int variable age. Have your program write "I hear you just had a birthday
and you are age years old." If age is 0 or less or 110 or more, call
error("you're kidding!").
6. Add this to your letter:
If your friend is under 12, write "Next year you will be age+1."
If your friend is 17, write "Next year you will be able to vote."
If your friend is over 70, write "I hope you are enjoying retirement."
Check your program to make sure it responds appropriately to each kind
of value.
7. Add "Yours sincerely," followed by two blank lines for a signature, followed by your name.

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
#include &lt;cmath&gt;
using namespace std;

int main()

	cout&lt;&lt;"    How are you? I am fine. I miss you "&lt;&lt;first_name+"."&lt;&lt;'\n';
	cout&lt;&lt;"Please enter the name of our friend followed by (enter)\n";
	string friend_name;
	cin&gt;&gt;friend_name;
	cout&lt;&lt;"Have you seen "&lt;&lt;friend_name&lt;&lt;" lately?\n";
	char friend_sex = 0;
	cout&lt;&lt;"Please enter an m if "&lt;&lt;friend_name&lt;&lt;" is a male and an f if "&lt;&lt;friend_name&lt;&lt;" a female\n";
    cin&gt;&gt;friend_sex;
	if(friend_sex == 'm')
	{
		cout&lt;&lt;"If you see "&lt;&lt;friend_name&lt;&lt;" please as him to call me\n";
	}
	else if (friend_sex == 'f')
	{
		cout&lt;&lt;"If you see "&lt;&lt;friend_name&lt;&lt;" please as her to call me\n";
	}
	//ask for age
	cout&lt;&lt;"What is the age of "&lt;&lt;friend_name&lt;&lt;"?\n";
	int age;
	cin&gt;&gt;age;
	cout&lt;&lt;"I hear you just had a birthday and you are "&lt;&lt;age&lt;&lt;" years old.\n";
	if(age &lt;= 0 && age &gt;= 110)
	{
		cout&lt;&lt;"you're kidding!\n";
	}
	else if(age &lt; 12)
	{
	    cout&lt;&lt;"Next year you will be "&lt;&lt;age+1;	
	}
	else if(age == 17)
	{
		cout&lt;&lt;"Next year you will be able to vote.";
	}

  myguess: serves as a way to ask a question and get input
  solution: prompts user to take action
2. Which operator do you use to read into a variable?
  myguess: two greater than symbols

3. If you want the user to input an integer value into your program for a variable named number, what are two lines of code you could write to ask the user to do it and to input the value into your program? 
  myguess:
  int number;
  cout&lt;&lt;"please enter two an integer value";
  cin>>number;
  
4. What is \n called and what purpose does it serve?
  myguess: newline, creates a new line to keep from clutter
  solution: newline, created a newline on the screen
5. What terminates input into a string?
  myguess: A string read using cinยป is (by default) terminated by whitespace; that is, it reads a single word.
  solution:
6. What terminates input into an integer?
  myguess: cinยป reads an integer into count
  solution: 
7. How would you write
cout &lt; "Hello, ";
cout &lt; first_name;
coul &lt; "!\n";
as a single line of code?
  myguess:
  cout&lt;"Hello, "&lt;&lt;first_name&lt;&lt;"!\n";

8. What is an object?
  myguess: the space a variable takes up
  solution: a region of memory with a type that specifies what kind of information can be placed in it

9. What is a literal?
  myguess: what something literally is
  solution:

10. What kinds of literals are there?
  myguess: string literals
  solution:

11. What is a variable?
  myguess: is a named object
  solution: a named object

12. What are typical sizes for a char, an int, and a double?
  myguess: char = 4 bytes, int = 8 bytes, double = 8 bytes
  solution:

int    = 4 bytes (32 bits)
bool   = 1 byte  (8 bits)
char   = 1 byte  (8 bits) 
double = 8 bytes (64 bits)

13. What measures do we use for the size of small entities in memory, such as ints and strings?
  myguess: bits and bytes
  solution: bits and bytes

14. What is the difference between = and ==?
  myguess: assignment and equivalence
  solution:
  
15. What is a definition?
  myguess:
  solution: a statement that introduces a new name into a program and sets aside memory for a variable is called a definition, i.e. a statement that defines a variable

16. What is an initialization and how does it differ from an assignment?
  myguess: initializing means the first assignment, assignment means its new role
  solution: initialization(giving a variable its initial value), assignment (giving a variable a new value)

17. What is string concatenation and how do you make it work in C++?
  myguess: adding two strings together with a plus operator
  solution: 

18. Which of the following are legal names in C++? If a name is not legal, why not?
This_little_pig    (starts with capital)
latest thing       (contains a space)

This_1_is_fine     (starts with capital)
the_$12_method     ($ character)
number
2_For_1_special    (starts with number)
_this_is_ok        (starts with underscore)
correct?

19. Give five examples of legal names that you shouldn't use because they are likely to cause confusion.
  myguess: abbreviations, capitalcases, do not start with underscore, do not use reserved(keywords) such as int,if,while,double
  solution:

20. What are some good rules for choosing names?
  myguess: no abbreviations, shortened, don't mix numbers
  solution:

21. What is type safety and why is it important?
  myguess: keeps from getting unseen errors
  solution: every object is given a type when it is defined. A program or part of a program - is type-safe when objects are used only according to the rules for their type.

22. Why can conversion from double to int be a bad thing?
  myguess:
  solution: the conversion results into information loss

23. Define a rule to help decide if a conversion from one type to 
another is safe or unsafe.
  myguess:
  solution:

uninitialized variable
"narrowing": narrowing conversion put a value into an object that may be too small to hold it.

bool to char
bool to int
bool to double
char to int
char to double
int to double

<p>5. Modify the program above to ask the user to enter floating point values and store them in double variables. Compare the outputs of the two programs for some inputs of your choice. Are the results the same? Should they be? What's the difference?</p>

<p>integer_value_report_modified.cpp</p>
<p>The results are slightly different, being that with floating point values the answer is more precise</p>

<p>6. Write a program that prompts the user to enter three integer values, and then outputs the values in numerical sequence separated by commas. So, if the user enters the values 10 4 6, the output should be 4, 6, 10. If two values are the same, they should just be ordered together. So, the input 454 should give 4, 4, 5.</p>

<p>three_integer_values_in_numerical_sequence.cpp</p>

<p>7. Do exercise 6, but with three string values. So, if the user enters the values "Steinbeck", "Hemingway", "Fitzgerald ", the output should be "Filzgerald, Hemingway, Steinbeck".</p>

<p>three_strings_in_alphabetical_order.cpp</p>

<p>8. Write a program to test an integer value to determine if it is odd or even. As always, make sure your output is clear and complete. In other words, don't just output "yes" or "no." Your Output should stand alone, like "The value 4 is an even number." Hint: See the remainder (modulo) operator in ยง3.4.</p>

<p>9. Write a program that converts spelledยทout numbers such as "zero" and "two" into digits, such as 0 and 2. When the user inputs a number, the program should print out the corresponding digit. Do it for the values 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 and write out "not a number I know" if the user enters something that doesn't correspond, such as "stupid computer!"</p>

<p>convert_spelledout_numbers.cpp</p>

<pre>10. Write a program that takes an operation followed by two operands and outputs the result. For example:
+ 100 3.14
โข 45
Read the operation into a string called operation and use an if-statement to figure out which operation the user wants, for example, if (operation=="+"). Read the operands into variables of type double. Implement this for operations called +, - , ., I, plus , minus, mul, and div with their obvious meanings.</pre>

<p>operation_two_operands_output_results.cpp</p>

<pre>11. Write a program that prompts the user to enter some number of pennies (1-cent coins), nickels (5-cent coins), dimes (1O-cent coins), quarters (25-cent coins), half dollars (50-cem coins), and one-dollar coins (1OO-cent coins). Query the user separately for the number of each size coin, e.g., "How many pennies do you have?" Then your program should print out something like this:
You have 23 pennies.
You have 17 nickels.
You have 14 dimes.
You have 7 quarters.
You have 3 half dollars.
The value of all of your coins is 573 cents. You may have to use your imagination to get the numbers to add up right-justified, but try; it can be done. Make some improvements: if only one of a coin is reported, make the output grammatically correct, e.g., " 14 dimes" and "1 dime" (not "1 dimes"). Also, report the sum in dollars and cents, i.e., $5.73 instead of 573 cents.</pre>

<p>Postscript: Do no underestimate the importance of the notion of type safety. Some of the most effective techniques for constructing programs rely on the design and use of types</p>

<p><b>Drill</b></p>
<pre>Go through this drill step by step. Do not try to speed up by skipping steps. Test
each step by entering at least three pairs of values - more values would be better.

1. write a program that consists of a while-loop that (each time around the
loop) reads in two ints and then prints them. Exit the program when a
terminating '|' is entered.

2. Change the program to write out the smaller value is: followed by the
smaller of the numbers and the larger value is: followed by the larger value.

3. Augment the program so that it writes the line the numbers are equal
(only) if they are equal.

4. Change the program so that it uses doubles instead of ints.

5. Change the program so that it writes out the numbers are almost equal
after writing out which is the larger and the smaller if the two numbers
differ by less than 1.0/10000000.

6. Now change the body of the loop so that it reads just one double each
time around. Define two variables to keep track of which is the smallest
and which is the largest value you have seen so far. Each time through
the loop write out the value emered. If it's the smallest so far, write the
smallest so far after the number. If it is the largest so far, write the largest
so far after the number.

7. Add a unit to each double entered; that is, enter values such as 10cm,
2.5in, 5ft, or 3.33m. Accept the four units: cm, m, in, ft. Assume conversion factors 1m == 100cm, 1in == 2.54cm, 1ft == 12in. Read the unit indicator into a string.

8. Reject values without units or with "illegal" representations of units, such
as y, yard , meter, km, and gallons.

9. Keep track of the sum of values entered (as well as the smallest and the largest) and the number of values entered. When you see the final '|' print the smallest, the largest, the number of values, and the sum of values. Note that to keep the sum, you have to decide on a unit to use for that sum; use meters.

10. Keep all the values entered (converted into meters) in a vector. At the
end, write out those values.

11. Before writing out the values from the vector, sort them (that'll make
them come out in increasing order).</pre>


<p><b>Review</b></p>
<pre>1. What is a computation?

the act of producing some outputs based on some inputs, Example: producing the result(output) from the argument(input) using the computation (function) square.

2. What do we mean by inputs and outputs to a computation? Give examples.

Taking in data  and doing something with it(computing).
Taking input from a user's keyboard and displaying what the input was on a screen/display.

3. What are the three requirements a programmer should keep in mind when expressing computations?

Correctly, simply, efficiently.

4. What does an expression do?

Computes a value from a number of operands.

5. What is the difference between a statement and an expression, as described in this chapter?

An expression computes a value from a set of operands using operators. Expressions are most basic building block of programs is an expression. An expression computes a value from a number of operands. The simplest expression is simply a literal value such as 10, 'a', 3.14, or "Noah." Names of variables are also expressions.

A statement is an instruction

if (expression) statement else statement
if (expression) statement else if (expression) statement

6. What is an lvalue? List me operators that require an lvalue. Why do
these operators, and not the others, require an lvalue?

Left value
Left-hand operand of the assignment or initialization
Refers to the object

The rvalue is the value of the name of the object
Refers to the value in the box

7. What is a constant expression?

Programs typically use a lot of constants. A symbolic constant is a named object to which you can't give a new value after it has been initialized. 

8. What is a literal?

A constant expression

9. What is a symbolic constant and why do we use them?

A named object to which you can't give a new value after it has been initialized.

const double pi = 3.14159;
pi = 7;
int v = 2*pi/r;

10. What is a magic constant? Give examples.

Non-obvious literals in code (outside const definitions) are derisively referred to magic constants.

11 . What are some operators that we can use for integers and floatingยทpoint values?

12. What operators can be used on integers but not on floatingยทpoint numbers?

<p><b>Exercises</b></p>
<pre>1. If you haven't already, do the Try this exercises from this chapter.

2. If we define the median of a sequence as "the number for which exactly
half of the elements of the sequence come before it and exactly half come
after it," fix the program in ยง4.6.2 so that it always prints out a median.
Hint: A median need not be an element of the sequence.

3. Read a sequence of double values into a vector. Think of each value as
the distance between two cities along a given route. Compute and print
the total distance (the sum of all distances). Find and print the smallest
and greatest distance between two neighboring cities. Find and print the
mean distance between two neighboring cities.

4. Write a program to play a numbers guessing game. The user thinks of a
number between 1 and 100 and your program asks questions to figure
out what the number is (e.g., "Is the number you are thinking of less
than 50?") . Your program should be able to identify the number after
asking no more than seven questions. Hint: Use the &lt; and &lt;= operators
and the ifยทelse construct.

5 . Write a program that perfonns as a very simple calculator.
Your calculator should be able to handle the five basic math operations - add, subtract,
multiply, divide, and modulus (remainder) - on two input values.
Your program should prompt the user to enter three arguments: two
double values and a character to represent an operation. If the entry arguments
are 35.6, 24.1 , and '+', the program output should be "The sum
of 35.6 and 24.1 is 59.7." In Chapter 6 we look at a much more sophisticated
simple calculator.

6. Make a vector holding the ten string values "zero", "one", ... "nine".
Use that in a program that converts a digit to its corresponding spelled-out
value; e.g., the input 7 gives the output seven. Have the same program,
using the same input loop, convert spelled-out numbers into their
digit form; e.g., the input seven gives the output 7.

7. Modify the "mini calculator" from exercise 5 to accept (just) single-digit
numbers written as either digits or spelled out.

8. There is an old story that the emperor wanted to thank the inventor of
the game of chess and asked the inventor to name his reward. The inventor
asked for one grain of rice for the first square, 2 for the second, 4
for the third, and so on, doubling for each of the 64 squares. That may
sound modest, but there wasn't that much rice in the empire! Write a
program to calculate how many squares are required to give the inventor
at least 1000 grains of rice, at least 1,000,000 grains, and at least
1,000,000,000 grains. You'll need a loop, of course, and probably an int
to keep track of which square you are at, an int to keep the number of
grains on the current square, and an int to keep track of the grains on all
previous squares. We suggest that you write out the value of all your variables
for each iteration of the loop so that you can see what's going on.

9. Try to calculate the number of rice grains that the inventor asked for in
exercise 8 above. You 'll find that the number is so large that it won't fit in
an int or a double. Observe what happens when the number gets too
large to represent as an int and as a double. What is the largest number
of squares for which you can calculate the exact number of grains (using
an int)? What is the largest number of squares for which you can calculate
the approximate number of grains (using a double)?

10. Write a program that plays the game "Rock, Paper, Scissors." If you are
not familiar with the game do some research (e.g., on the web using
Coogle). Research is a common task for progra.mmers. Use a switchstatement
to solve this exercise. Also, the machine should give random
answers (i.e., select the next rock, paper, or scissors randomly). Real randomness
is too hard to provide just now, so just build a vector with a sequence
of values to be used as "the next value." If you build the vector
into the program, it will always play the same game, so maybe you
should let the user enter some values. Try variations to make it less easy
for the user to guess which move the machine will make next.

11. Create a program to find all the prime numbers between 1 and 100. One
way to do this is to write a function that will check if a number is prime
(i.e., see if the number can be divided by a prime number smaller than itยท
self) using a vector of primes in order (so that if the vector is called
primes, primes[O]==2, primes[1]==3, primes[2]==5, etc.). Then write a
loop that goes from 1 to 100, checks each number to see if it is a prime,
and stores each prime found in a vector. Write another loop that lists the
primes you found. You might cheek your result by comparing your
vector of prime numbers with primes. Consider 2 the first prime.

12. Modify the program described in the previous exercise to take an input
value max and then find all prime numbers from 1 to max.

13. Create a program to find all the prime numbers bctween 1 and 100.
There is a classic method for doing this, called the "Sieve of Eratosยท
thenes." If you don't know that method, get on the web and look it up.
Write your program using this method.

14. Modify the program described in the previous exercise to take an input
value max and then find all prime numbers from 1 to max.

15. Write a program that takes an input value n and then finds the first n
primes.

16. In the drill, you wrote a program that, given a series of numbers, found
the max and min of that series. The number that appears the most times
in a sequence is called the mode. Create a program that finds the mode of
a set of positive integers.

17. Write a program that finds the min, max, and mode of a sequence of
strings.

18. Write a program to solve quadratic equations. A quadratic equation is of
the form

ax2+bx+c=O

If you don't know the quadratic formula for solving such an expression,
do some research. Remember, researching how to solve a problem is
often necessary before a programmer can teach the computer how to
solve it. Use doubles for the user inputs for a, b, and c. Since there are
two solutions to a quadratic equation, Output both x1 and x2.

19. Write a program where you first enter a set of nameยทandยทvalue pairs,
such as Joe 17 and Barbara 22. For each pair, add the name to a vector
called names and the number to a vector called scores (in corresponding
positions, so that if names[7]=="Joe" then scores[7]==18). Terminate
input by the line No more ("more" will make the attempt to read another
integer fail). Check that each name is unique and terminate with an error
message if a name is entered twice. Write out all the (name,score) pairs,
one per line.

20. Modify the program from exercise 19 so that when you enter a name,
the program will output the corresponding score or "name not found".

21. Modify the program from exercise 19 so that when you enter an integer,
the program will output all the names with that score or "score not
found".
