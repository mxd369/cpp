===========================1.5

A) _____ initially became widely known as the development language of the Unix operating
system.
a) C
answer: C language

B) The _____ programming language was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s at Bell Laboratories.
b) C++
answer: C++ language

===========================1.6
A) C++ programs normally go through six phases— ______, ______, ______,
______,______ and ______.
a) compile, link, _____, _____, ______, and ______
answer:
Edit: editing of the file done with editig program. such as vi or emacs

Preprocess: In case of preprocess, command is being provided for compiling the program. It is executed before the compiler translator phase begins. It obeys commands known as preprocessing directives which helps in indicating the manipulation that need to be performed before compilation of the program begins.

Compile: In case of compulation, program is being translated to machien language code. It can be said as object code.

Link: Linker is use for linking the object code with the code for the missing function so as to create executable code. If the compilation and linking is doen properly then it results in producing executable image.

Load: Loading of the program is done by the loader. Loader basically takes the executable image which is begin produced by the linker and this that executable image is transfer to the memory.

Execute: Execution of each and every function of the program begins but one instruction is executed at a specified time

B) A(n) _____ provides many tools that support the software development process, such as editors for writing and editing programs, debuggers for locating logic errors in programs, and many other features.
b) IDE
answer: IDE integrated development environment
===========================1.7
Discuss the following terms and concepts that applies to the notion of a watch:
object,
attributes,
behavior,
class,
inheritance(consider for example, an alarm clock),
modeling,
messages,
encapsulation,
interface,
information hiding.


Object Oriented Concepts

Object - watch itself is an object.

Attributes - some of the attributes of a watch are brand name, color, type, model number.

Behaviors - Displaying time and allowing adjustments. 

Class - A clock is a class from which the object watch is derived.

Inheritance - inherits properties of an alarm clock object, date object.

Abstraction - mechanism of a watch is not known to the user of it. Only the outer appearance and the output functionality of the watch is provided to the user.

Modeling - A watch is modeled by adding various functionalities like displaying time, setting time, rotating needles.

Messages - When the key rod of a watch is rotated, a message is sent to the watch to adjust time accordingly. Since wathc is a mechanical device, messages are in the form of physical action of different parts.

Encapsulation - The mechanism such as how the needles in a watch rotate and how the time is set are encapsulated in a watch.

Interface - An interface between the user and the machine inside a wathc would allow getting and setting the time. The key rod is an interface to the watch.

Information hiding - The details such as how the time is set when key rod is rotated and how the time is being displayed are hidden. The inner functioning and implementations are encapsulated in the machine.
