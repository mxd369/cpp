d) newline
answer: newline

E) The _____ statement is used to make decisions.
e) if
answer: if

===========================2.2

State whether each of the following is true or false. If false, explain why. Assume the statement using std::cout; is used.

A) Comments cause the computer to print the text after the // on the screen when the program is executed.
a) false, comments written after // are ignore
answer: False, comments do not cause any action to be performed when the program is executed. They're used to document programs and improve their readability.

B) The escape sequence \n, when output with cout and the stream insertion operator, causes the cursor to position to the beginning of the next line on the screen.
b) true
answer: true

C) All variables must be declared before they’re used.
c) true
answer: true

D) All variables must be given a type when they’re declared.
d) true
answer: true

E) C++ considers the variables number and NuMbEr to be identical.
e) false, C++ is case sensitive
answer: False, c++ is case sensitive, so these variables are different.

F) Declarations can appear almost anywhere in the body of a C++ function.
f) true
answer: true

G) The remainder operator (%) can be used only with integer operands.
g) true
answer: true


H) The arithmetic operators *, /, %, + and – all have the same level of precedence.
h) false, there is precedence:
( )    parentheses
* / %  multiplication division remainder
+ -    addition subtraction 
answer: the operators *, / and % have the same precedece, and the operators + and - have a lower precedence.

I) A C++ program that prints three lines of output must contain three statements using cout and the stream insertion operator.
i) false, can use new line
answer: false, one statement with cout and multiple \n escape sequences can print several liines.

===========================2.3

B) Prompt the user to enter an integer. End your prompting message with a colon (:) followed by a space and leave the cursor positioned after the space.
b) std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";
answer: std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";

C) Read an integer from the user at the keyboard and store it in integer variable age.
c) std::cin >> age;
answer: std::cin >> age;

D) If the variable number is not equal to 7, print "The variable number is not equal to 7".

answer:
std::cout << "This is a C++\nprogram\n";

G) Print the message "This is a C++ program" with each word on a separate line.
g) std::cout << "This\n is\n a\n C++\n program\n";
answer:
std::cout << "This\nis\na\nC++\nprogram\n";

H) Print the message "This is a C++ program". Separate each word from the next by a tab.
h) std::cout "This\t is\t a\t C++\t program\t";
answer:
std::cout << "This\tis\ta\tC++\tprogram\t";

answer:


F) Print "The product is " followed by the value of the variable result.
f)
cout << "The product is " << result << endl;
answer:
cout < "The product is " << result << endl;

G) Return a value from main indicating that the program terminated successfully.
g)
return 0;
answer:
return 0;

===========================2.5
Using the statements you wrote in Exercise 2.4, write a complete program that calculates and displays the product of three integers. Add comments to the code where appropriate. [Note: You’ll need to write the necessary using directives.]

// program: calculates the product of three integers
#include <iostream>
using std::cout;
using std::cin;
using std::endl;
int main(){
	int x;
	int y;
	int z;
	int result;
	cout << "Enter three integer values: "<< endl;
	cin >> x >> y >> z;
	result = x * y * z;
	cout << "Result " << result << endl;
	return 0;
}

answer:

// Calculate the product of three integers
#include <iostream> // enables program to perform input and output
using namespace std; // program uses names from the std namespace

// function main begins program execution
int main(){
	int x{0}; 		// first integer to multiply
	int y{0}; 		// second integer to multiply
	int z{0}; 		// third integer to multiply
	int result{0};	// the product of the three integers
	cout << "Enter three integer values: "<< endl; // prompt user for data
	cin >> x >> y >> z; // read three integers from user
	result = x * y * z; // multiply the three integers; store result
	cout << "The product is " << result << endl; // print result; end line
	return 0;
} // end function main

===========================2.6
Identify and correct the errors in each of the following statements (assume that the statement using std::cout; is used):

a) if ( c < 7 ); // <- cannot end if statement without body needs {}
	cout << "c is less than 7\n";

Answer: Error: semicolon after the right parenthesis of the condition in the if statement. 

Correction: remove the semicolon after the right parenthsis. [Note: The result of this error is that the output statement executes whether or not the condition in the if statement is true.] The semicolon after the right parenthesis is a null (or empty) statement that does nothing.

b) if ( c => 7 ) // <- incorrect comparator operator must be >=
	cout << "c is equal to or greater than 7\n";

Answer: Error: incorrect realtional operator =>.

Correction: Change => to >=, and you may want to change "equal to or greater than" to "greater than or equal to" as well.

(Integer Equivalent of a Character) Here is a peek ahead. In this chapter you learned about integers and the type int. C++ can also represent uppercase letters, lowercase letters and a considerable variety of special symbols. C++ uses small integers internally to represent each different character. The set of characters a computer uses and the corresponding integer representations for those characters are called that computer’s character set. You can print a character by enclosing that character in single quotes, as with

	cout << 'A'; // print an uppercase A

You can print the integer equivalent of a character using static_cast as follows:

	cout << static_cast< int >( 'A' ); // print 'A' as an integer

This is called a cast operation (we formally introduce casts in Chapter 4). When the preceding statement executes, it prints the value 65 (on systems that use the ASCII character set). Write a program that prints the integer equivalent of a character typed at the keyboard. Store the input in a variable of type char. Test your program several times using uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits and special characters (like $).

2.30 (Body Mass Index Calculator) We introduced the body mass index (BMI) calculator in Exercise 1.9. The formulas for calculating BMI are

	BMI = weightInPounds * 703 / heightInInches * heightInInches

or

	BMI = weightInKilograms / heightInMeters

Create a BMI calculator application that reads the user’s weight in pounds and height in inches (or, if you prefer, the user’s weight in kilograms and height in meters), then calculates and  the user’s body mass index. Also, the application should display the following information from the Department of Health and Human Services/National Institutes of Health so the user can evaluate his/her BMI:


BMI VALUES
Underweight: less than 18.5
Normal:		 between 18.5 and 24.9
Overweight:	 between 25 and 29.9
Obese:		 30 or greater


[Note: In this chapter, you learned to use the int type to represent whole numbers. The BMI calculations when done with int values will both produce whole-number results. In Chapter 4 you’ learn to use the double type to represent numbers with decimal points. When the BMI calculations are performed with doubles, they’ll both produce numbers with decimal points—these are called
“floating-point” numbers.]
