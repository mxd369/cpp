/*
(Integer Equivalent of a Character) Here is a peek ahead. In this chapter you learned about integers and the type int. C++ can also represent uppercase letters, lowercase letters and a considerable variety of special symbols. C++ uses small integers internally to represent each different character. The set of characters a computer uses and the corresponding integer representations for those characters are called that computerâ€™s character set. You can print a character by enclosing that character in single quotes, as with

	cout << 'A'; // print an uppercase A

You can print the integer equivalent of a character using static_cast as follows:

	cout << static_cast< int >( 'A' ); // print 'A' as an integer

This is called a cast operation (we formally introduce casts in Chapter 4). When the preceding statement executes, it prints the value 65 (on systems that use the ASCII character set). Write a program that prints the integer equivalent of a character typed at the keyboard. Store the input in a variable of type char. Test your program several times using uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits and special characters (like $).
