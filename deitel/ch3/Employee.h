/*
(Employee Class) Create a class called Employee that includes three pieces of information as data members—a first name (type string), a last name (type string) and a monthly salary (type int). [Note: In subsequent chapters, we’ll use numbers that contain decimal points (e.g., 2.75)— called floating-point values—to represent dollar amounts.] Your class should have a constructor that initializes the three data members. Provide a set and a get function for each data member. If the monthly salary is not positive, set it to 0.
