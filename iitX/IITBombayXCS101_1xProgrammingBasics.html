<h2>1: Procedures, programs, and computers</h2>
<pre>
Translation/Compilation: The computer will first read and understand the entire program before it initiates and tasks. Once it fully understands it, then it will run the program in specified order.

Which of the following is more appropriately defined as a manual?
document giving assistance to people using a particular system
The manual is a communication document used to assist people in the basic operation of a particular system.

A simple program:
Use location A, B, SUM;
Input A;
Input B;
SUM = A + B;
Output SUM;


A drawer in Dumbo’s memory cannot be empty. Each drawer always has some value in it. This stipulation is to ensure that our memory model is similar to the memory of real computers, where each location always contains some value. 

COUNT = COUNT + 1; //will execute the instruction, and will change the value in the location COUNT. The value of the COUNT will thus be incremented by 1.


Q. Rice is planted and grown in paddy fields. A field is divided into a number (N) of rectangular patches of the same length (L) and breadth (B). It takes a person 5 minutes to plant saplings in a patch of size one sq. meter. Suppose there are P persons available to do the planting. How much time will it take in hours (H) and Minutes (M), for planting saplings in the entire field?

(a) Develop a computational procedure to solve this problem.

(b) Write a program for Dumbo, which will implement this computational procedure, and get us the total time required in Hours and Minutes.

int N; // number of rectangular patches
N = L * B // L(Length) B(Breadth)
time per_person_plant_patch_size_one_sq_meter = 5;
int P; // number of persons available to do the planting
int time_taken_entire_field;
time_taken_entire_field = N / P;

Integers
base10 = decimal (0-9)
base2  = binary  (0-1)

Decimal Representation example:
233 = 2*10^2 + 3*10^1 + 3*10^0
Binary Representation example:
110 = 1x2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 6 (the binary representation of 6)

1011 in decimal = 1*10^3 + 1*10*1 + 1*10*0

1011 = 1*2^3 + ...
1011 = 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + ...
1011 = 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + ...
1011 = 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 11

Q1
Use locations NBOYS, NGIRLS, NSTUDENTS;
NBOYS = 35;
NGIRLS = 124;
NSTUDENTS = 80;
Input NBOYS;
Input NGIRLS;
Output NSTUDENTS;
NSTUDENTS = NBOYS + NGIRLS;

Suppose the user types 12 and 28 as input values for the locations NBOYS and NGIRLS respectively. The output value displayed by Dumbo on our monitor screen will be?
myguess: 40
incorrect 

answer: 80
EXPLANATION
Since the NSTUDENTS is output/displayed before the addition of NBOYS and NGIRLS is computed, the old value stored in NSTUDENTS i.e. 80 will get displayed.

Q2
Consider the program below.

  i.    Use locations A, B;
 ii.    Output "Give A and B: ";
iii.    Input A; Input B;
 iv.    A = A + B;
  v.    B = A + B;
 vi.    Output "B is: ";
vii.    Output B;

Suppose the user provides 10 and 20 as the values of A and B respectively when Dumbo executes the above instructions. What value will be output by Dumbo after printing "B is: "?

myguess: 50

answer: 50 correct
EXPLANATION
Using Input A and Input B statements, Mr. Dumbo assigns the values 10 and 20 to locations 'A' and 'B' respectively.
No.     Statement             After execution of the statement
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
iii.    Input A; Input B;     A = 10 and B = 20
 iv.    A = A + B;            A = 10 + 20 = 30, 10 and 20 is added assigned to A
  v.    B = A + B;            B = 30 + 20 = 50, 
                              B is assigned as 50 by 
                              adding the computed value of A (in the previous 
                              step, i.e. 30) to 20(the original value of B from iii).
Hence, the output displayed by dumbo will be B is: 50

iii.  Input A; Input B;
 iv.  A = B;
  v.  B = A * B;
 vi.  Output "B is: ";

What should be the value typed by the user as input for location B, so that the output produced is "B is: 361"?

choices: 16,18,20,None of the choices
myguess: None of the choices
solution: None of the choices
EXPLANATION
The input given by the user for location 'A' does not matter, as the value of location 'B' is assigned to location 'A' in step iv. At this point the value of 'A' and 'B' are same. In step v, the product of 'A'('B') and 'B' is obtained, which is essentially B2 and stored in 'B'. In the next step the modified value of 'B' is printed. This Dumbo program actually computes the square of 'B'. To obtain a value '361', the value of 'B' should be 19. Hence, the answer 'None of the choices'.

Characters see on the keyboard to be displayed on the screen such as A,0, or P is treated as an unsigned 8bit integer. It is going to be represetned as a byte. It is represented by a byte and therefore it is an 8 bit integer without a sign, uses this encoding of characters as unsigned 8 bit integer also called ASCII encoding(American Standard Code for information interchange.)

char data type
  unsigned char
  char userInput
  unsigned char numChild

constant characters
  specified as unisgned integers in 0 through 255
    const char userInput = 89;
    const char defaultOutput = 0x4e;  // hexidecimal
  specified as character symbol within ' '
    const char userInput = 'Y';
	const char defaultOutput = 'N';


Strings
  A sequence(array) of characters terminated by a special end-of-string character
  can be declared as an array of characters
    Give input: \0
	0123456789ABCD
    char myString[12];
	    in Dumbo program: Output "Give input: ";
        C++ program: cout &lt;&lt; "Give input:";
  Constant Strings in C++
    const string myMessage("Hello world!")
	//cannot be changed during program execution


Representing Booleans
  datatype bool
  C++ declaration: bool flag;
  Boolean constants in C++: true, false
    const bool trueValue = true;

Putting it All Together in C++ program:
  Read two numbers from keyboard, add and display on console

<pre>Structure of a Simple C++ Program
-A program is a sequence of directives, declarations and instructions
-Written according to some rules, computer languages also have grammars
-Stored in one(or more) files, add_two_numbers.cpp

C++ Program:
// file add_two_numbers.cpp
#include &lt;iostream>                // compiler directives
using namespace std;
// this program reads two integers
// calculates the sum
int main(){
  int A,B,C;
  cout &lt;&lt; "Give two numbers ";
  cin >> A >> B;
  C = A + B;
  cout &lt;&lt; "The sum is: " &lt;&lt; C &lt;&lt; '\n';
  return 0;
}

Compiler Directives:
#include &lt;iostream>
  include instructions from iostream header file
  input/output handled as 'streams' of bytes
    input stream converted to internal representation of computer
	internal representation converted to stream of displayable characters
  "cin" (for keyboard input) and "cout" (for console output) work because of instructions in "iostream" header file

using namespace std;
  names of objects in a program can be grouped in "namespaces"
    analogy: names of students in CS101 grouped in divisions
  each "namespace" can be given a name
    analogy: each division can be given a name
  references, indicate which 'namespace' we are referring to
    analogy: Shyam from division E
	C++ programs: myNameSpace::myVarName
  can use same name in different namespaces
    Shyam from division E different from Shyam from division A
	myNameSpace1::myVarName different from myNameSpace2::myVarName
  "using namespace std" asks compiler to use global namespace called "std"
    myVarName refers to std::myVarName


"main" function
  literally, the main part of the program
  operating system invokes this function when you run your compiled program
    can pass one or more parameters to this function
	none passed in our example
  operating system gets back control of computer when this function ends


Variables and declarations
  variables
    basic computational objects
  declarations
    each varaible must be named
	for each variable, we must indicate type of value it can store
  a variable must be declared before it is used
  "using namespace std"
    int A,B,C; really means int std::A,std::B,std::C;


input/output statements
  how interaction occures with the program
  "cin" inputs
  "cout" outputs

Assignment(an other) Statements
  C= A + B;
    A + B // Arithmetic expression
	C // Destination of assignment

"return Statement"
  A function is called/invoked
    by operating system(e.g. "main" function)
	by another function
  "return" returns control to caller
    in our example, the operating system
  can also return a value to caller
    useful for returning result of computation
	useful for indicating error status


blocks of statements/Grouping statements
  statements can be grouped by enclosing them within a pair of '{' and '}'
    each group is treated as one logical unit of the program
	useful for demarcating logical parts of a program
	each group can have its own variable declarations


comments
  //
  /*
  */
  essential for readability of program
  completely ignored by compiler


the structure of a simple C++ program:
  compiler directives,
  "main" function,       //the main function
  variable declarations,
  input/output statements,
  assignment statements, // and other statements
  "return",              //return statement

<pre>Names and Type Declarations in C++

Simple C++ Functions and Types

Friendly Sum Program: 
int main(){
  int A,B,C;
  cout &lt;&lt; "Give two numbers";
  cin >> A >> B;
  C = A + B;
  cout &lt;&lt; "Sum is" &lt;&lt; C;
  return 0;
}

Function to add integers:
//int A, int B are input Parameters
int addTwoInts(int A, int B){
  int C;
  C = A + B;
  return C;
}

Friendly Sum Program modified with add function
int main(){
  int A,B,C;
  cout &lt;&lt; "Give two numbers";
  cin >> A >> B;
  C = addTwoInts(A,B);
  cout &lt;&lt; "Sum is" &lt;&lt; C;
  return 0;
}

/*
So this is a declaration for the function, just like we have a declaration for variable, we must declare a function before we use it. So this is the declaration of the function. The main function here reads two numbers A and B and then it invokes this function addTwoInts, passing A and B as parameters to this function. We will look much more about how to invoke functions and how to invoke
*/

Summary
what we've seen in this lecture is that there are certain rules for assigning names in C++. Names need to be associated with variables, functions and in general to any computational object that you have in your program. Type declarations are absolutely essential for any named entity in your program. Variables must have type declarations, functions must have type declarations, function parameters must have type declarations, function return values must have type declarations. And we've looked at some commonly used types just to illustrate how to write a program with named variables, functions, and how to declare the types of these variables and functions.

<pre>Assignment Statement and Arithmetic Expressions
Assignment statement
Arithmetic expressions

Assignment Statement
  destination = expression;
  // computes the value of expression and store in destination
  Expression
    refers to values of variables
	refers to operators
	evaluates to a value
	a value must have a type
	  how much memory to store?
	  how to interpret stored bits?
	Expression must have a type

Arithmetic Expressions in C++
  a, b, c: variables
  +, -, *, /, %: operators
  a + b, a - b, b * c, a / c, a%b: arithmetic expressions

  How many bytes to store in memory?
  How are the stored bits interpretted?
    Depends on the various operands in the expression(depends on data types of a and b).
    a and b are both integer(type int)

Type of an Arithmetic Expression
RULE of THUMB
  Expression type at least as "expressive" as operand types, but no more
    Example: float a and int b
	  float "more expressive" than int
I can express int values as floating point numbers but not necessarily the other way around.

  a+b, a-b, a*b, a/b are all float
  2 * b is int,
  2.0 * b is float  // must be float
  
  double a, float b and int c
    double "more expressive" than float
	float "more expressive" than int
	a + (b * c) has type double

  int a,b,c;
  a = 1;b = 2;
  c = a/b;
  // c = 0
  // Type of a/b: int
  // Value of a/b: 0 (value of a/b will be the integer part of 1/2)
  
  int a;
  float b, c;
  a = 1;b = 2.0;
  c = a/b;
  // c = 0.5
  // Type of a/b: float
  // Value of a/b: 0.5 (float can represent fractions)
  
Operator Precedence
  What is a + b * c + d?
    in C++, * has higher precedence than +: a + (b*c) + d
  What is a + b - c + d?
    in C++, - and + have equal precedence therefore: a+b - c+d
	from now left to right evaluation for same precdence operators
	  //this is called left-associative
    * , / and % have same precedence, and are left associative:
	  ((a%b)/c)*d
  Best practice is to use Parentheses
    can be used to override default operator precedences
    evaluate from innermost parenthesized expression outwards


summary, what we looked at in this lecture is the assignment statement in C++.
We looked at arithmetic expressions, how to obtain their types, values. And, we also looked at the use of parentheses in arithmetic expressions.

Dealing with Logical Expressions

Program with arithmetic expression
int main(){
    int A, B, C;
	cout &lt;&lt; "Give two numbers";
	cin >> A >> B;
	C = A + B;                        //Arithmetic Expression
    cout &lt;&lt; "Sum is" &lt;&lt; C;
	return 0;
}

Program with logical expression
int main(){
    int A, B, C;
	bool isALargest;
	cout &lt;&lt; "Give three numbers";
	cin >> A >> B >> C;
	isALargest = ((A>=B)&&(A>=C))
	cout &lt;&lt; "Is A the largest: ";
	cout &lt;&lt; isALargest;
	return 0;
}


Logical Expressions in C++
  Simplest: Comparing int or float
  (A>B),(A&lt;C),(B>=C),(A&lt;=C) //logical expressions, data type bool, evalute to true/false
  (A==B),(B!=C) //equality based logical expressions
  ( A == B ) is A equal to B?     //denotes assignment of value B to A
  ( B != C ) is B not equal to C? //equality comparison of values A and B
  Can use expressions instead of variables when comparing
  (((A+B)*C)&lt;((C-A)%B))
  
  Logical Operators
  && (two ampersands) binary logical "and" (A>=B)&&(A>=C)
  || (two vertical bars) binary logical "or" (A>B)||(A>C)
  ! (exclamation symbol) unary logical "not" negation !((A>=B)&&(A>=C))
  
  Complex logical Expressions use parentheses
  ((A>=B)&&(A>=C))||((A==1)&&(B!=(A+C))
  
  Always evaluates to a value of type bool
  
  Logical Operators
    Comparison operators
	  &lt;,&lt=,>,>=: same precedence, lower than !, left-associative
	  ==,!=: same precedence, lower than &lt;, left associative
	  A>=B != B&lt;C interpretted as (A>=B)!=(B&lt;C)
	Logical operators
	  ! : highest precedence
	  &&:precedence lower than ==, left-associative
	  ||:precedence lower than &&, left-associative
	  !flag1 || flag2 && !flag3 interpretted as
	  (!flag1) || (flag2 && (!flag3)
	best practice: Use(...) to specify meaning unambiguously
	
  Printing Logical Expressions
    logical expression has value true or false
	internal representation
	  At least 1 byte, could be 4 bytes as well
	  false represented as 0
	  true represented as non-zero(not necessarily 1)
    Default printing
	  true printed as 1
	  false printed as 0
	  using manipulator boolalpha, can print true or false
	    cout &lt;&lt; boolalpha &lt;&lt;(A>B);

we saw in this lecture,
logical expressions in C++,
how we can construct simple expressions with comparison operators,
how we can combine these simple expressions into more complicated expressions using logical operators and parentheses.
And we also saw what happens when we print logical values.

<p>Sequential Execution in C++ Programs</p>
<pre>Sequential Execution in C++ Programs
programs: sequence of compiler directives, declarations, instructions
The compiler directives are instructions to the compiler that it uses when it tries to compile your C++ program to the machine's language, the computer's internal language.

Declarations tell the compiler what variables are to be used. Declarations are mostly about variables in the programs that we are going to see. A declaration tells how much memory to allocate for storing the value of variables, for example, if a variable is declared as an integer, then four bytes of memory have to be allocated for it and a declaration also tells how to interpret the bit stored in those memory locations allocated for a variable, for example, whether it is a signed integer or an unsigned integer or a floating point number. The compiler gets to know this information from the declarations.

instructions tell computer what to do, by sequencing instructions carefully, we can get a computer to do highly non-trivial tasks efficiently.

simplest programs: linear sequence of isntructions, computer executes instructions in linear order.

Program with arithmetic expression
int main(){
    int A, B, C;
	cout &lt;&lt; "Give two numbers";
	cin >> A >> B;
	C = A + B;                        //Arithmetic Expression
    cout &lt;&lt; "Sum is" &lt;&lt; C;
	return 0;
}

see our friendly summing program which reads two integers, adds them up and prints the sum out on your screen and on the right hand side, here I have shown the computer screen as it might appear as the instructions in this program are executed sequentially. So this is the main function, the operating system calls this main function, passes control to this main function and when this main function executes, the first statement here is really a declaration. So there is nothing for the computer to execute as far as this, as far as this declaration is concerned. This is really a directive to the compiler to reserve appropriate amounts of storage in the memory and to interpret the bits stored in those locations in the appropriate way. This declaration is saying that there are going to be three variables all of them of type integer. The next statement is really the first statement that the computer executes and I have sort of, I have sort of shown that here by a running icon. So when the computer executes the statement, this is what you see on your screen. This is the prompt. It could be your favorite prompt and then the computer prints, after that give two numbers. The computer after executing the statement is going to execute the instruction that appears exactly after this in the sequence in which the instructions in the program are written. So the next instruction the computer will execute is the reading of the values of A and B. Now when the computer executes this statement, it is waiting for the user to input the values of A and B from the keyboard, so perhaps the user enters 23 and then presses the enter key but that gives the computer only the value of A but as this instruction was asking the computer to read both the values of A and B, so the computer is still waiting and then the user enters -300 and enter and now the computer has read the values of both A and B. So it is done executing this instruction and it is now going to go and execute exactly the next instruction that appears in sequence after it. In this case it is, C assigned A + B. When the computer executes the instruction, it does this instruction internally. Nothing shows up on the screen. But after executing this instruction, the computer goes to this instruction and as it executes it on the screen we get this message "Sum is" space followed by values of C, in this case it is -277 and then the computer executes return 0 which basically passes control back to operating system. Recall that the operating system had called the function main and when the control passes back to the operating system, we get back the prompt on our screen.So this is exactly how a computer executes instructions in sequence as they are specified in the program. Note also that this semi colon is basically used to separate one executable statement from the next. So you could put two executable statements on the same line. You don't need to break the line, but as long as you put the semi colon between them, it is clear that the execution to the left of the semi colon, the statement to the left of the semi colon will be executed first and then the statement to the right of the semi colon. 

Program with logical expression
int main(){
    int A, B, C;
	bool isALargest;
	cout &lt;&lt; "Give three numbers";
	cin >> A >> B >> C;
	isALargest = ((A>=B)&&(A>=C))
	cout &lt;&lt; "Is A the largest: ";
	cout &lt;&lt; isALargest;
	return 0;
}

example of sequential execution of statements in a program. This is our program which we have seen earlier that takes three numbers and tells us whether the first number read is the largest of the three, so here once again the first statement here is a declaration. There is nothing for the computer to do. This basically tells the compiler how much storage to allocate for these variables. The second statement is also a declaration. This is saying is ALargest is a boolean variable , so once again nothing for the computer to execute. This is just telling the compiler how much memory to allocate for this variable in memory. The next statement is the real statement that the computer executes shown by this running icon And when it executes the statement, this is what we get on the screen. This is the end line which means, the cursor returns to the beginning of the next line. After that, the computer executes this statement where it is trying to read the values of A, B and C. Suppose the user enters 23 and presses that gives the computer only the value of A, it still needs to read the values of B and C. So it waits. And the user can then enter -300 space 20 and then Enter. This space basically tells the computer that -300 is to be read as the value of B and 20 is to be read as the value of C and once it has read all of these three integers, then the computer goes to execute the next instruction. And, this if you recall from an earlier lecture is nothing but a logical expression. So, the computer evaluates this logical expression for the given values of A, B and C. You can check for yourself that this logical expression evaluates to true. So, this boolean variable isALargest gets set to the value true. But when the computer executes this statement, this assignment statement, there is really nothing that you can see on the screen, this is executed internally inside the computer. After executing the statement, it executes the next output statement and when the  executes that, we get an output on the screen isALargest colon space and then the value of isALargest for the given values of A, B and C is indeed the largest. So this boolean variable gets set to true and we have seen that when we are trying to output the value for boolean variable that is true we are going to get 1. And after the statement is executed the computer executes returns 0, control passes back to the operating system and you get your prompt back on your computer screen.


sequential execution of programs
  all variables must be declared before being used
  executable statements executed in sequence from "top" to "bottom"
  if a statement changes value of a variable, and a "later"/"below" statement refers to the variable, it sees the changed value
  executing a "return" statement returns control back to the caller(function/OS)
    subsequent statemnets not executed


Programming to solve problems
  given a problem:
    "Given two integers A and B, find if B divides A?"
  Think of sequence of steps you would take if solving by pencil-and-paper
  // one way of solving this problem.
    Find the remainder of A on division by B
	if remainder is 0, then B divides A, otherwise not
You would find the remainder of A on division by b and if the remainder is 0, then you would say yes, B divides A, otherwise you would say B does not divide A. Now having come up with this recipe for solving this problem, we can then think in terms of program statements that we have seen so far and see, can we sequence the program statements using the constructs that we have studied so far in a linear order such that we basically get the same effect as executing these two steps in our pencil-and-paper style of solving this problem. Now one thing that you note here is that, here, I said if remainder is 0, then, do something otherwise do something. So, this is really conditional execution of statements and we didn’t learn how to do this so far in our programs. So, is it the case that we cannot solve this problem? Well, this is also an opportunity to think a little bit and find out, is there a way to solve our problem without using conditional execution of statements just by linear sequence of instructions. And in the case of this problem it turns out that we can solve this problem by linear sequence of instructions. So, we could do the following. We could calculate the remainder of A divided by B in C++. This can be used, this can be achieved by using the percent operator or the remainder operator, then we can set a boolean flag to true if R equals 0 and to false otherwise. This can be achieved in C++ through this assignment statement. Note that the right hand side of the assignment is a logical expression, because I am using a comparison operator here. And finally I could output the flag and clearly in this case the flag is true if and only if B divides A. So, now we could write a simple C++ program to solve the same problem. We start off by compiler directives.These we have already seen in an earlier lecture, what these mean. I am not going to repeat them here. Then we write a comment. It’s always a good idea to say in a comment what your program is doing. Here is our main function. Here are the two braces between which the block of statements for this main function is going to appear. We first declare three integer variables and a boolean variable.Then we print out a message saying give the values of A and B followed by end of line. Then we read the values of A and B. We calculate the remainder of A divided by B. Set the flag to true if R equals 0, if the remainder equals zero. Otherwise this flag gets set to false. And then we say “Does B divide A?” and we output the value of the flag. So, if B indeed divides A, we will see on our screen Does B divide A? space one, because the boolean value true will be output as 1 and if B does not divide A, we will get Does B divide A? space zero and finally we return 0. An important thing to note here is the sequence in which these two instructions appeared. R is A percent B and dividesFlag is equal to equal to zero. So, it’s an interesting question to ask what would happen if we swapped the order of these two instructions and it’s not hard to see that if dividesFlag assigned R equal to equal to 0 appears before R is assigned A percent B, then the value of R that is going to be used when I am executing this statement would be the garbage value

#include &iostream>
using namespace std;
// Program to find if B divides A
int main(){
	// declare three integer variables and a boolean variable
	int A, B, R;      // Variable declarations
	bool dividesFlag; // Variable declarations
	cout &lt;&lt; "Give A and B:" &lt;&lt; endl;
	cin >> A >> B;
    //calculate the remainder of A divided by B
	R =  A % B; // remainder of A divided by B
    // set the flag to true if R equals 0, if the remainder is 0, otherwise this flag gets set to false
	dividesFlag = (R == 0); // is the remainder 0?
	cout &lt;&lt; "Does B divide A?" &lt;&lt; dividesFlag &lt;&lt; endl;
	return 0;
	/* 
	note: the importance of the sequence: What happens if we swap the order of R = A%B and dividesFlag = (R == 0) 
    */
}


Summary:
what we saw in this lecture is sequential execution of statements in C++ programs and we also got an initial glimpse into how we could solve problems by programming. Of course without conditional execution of statements we are handicapped and we are going to look at the conditional execution of statements in C++ in the next lecture. Nevertheless some interesting problems can still be solved by just sequentially executing the instructions in a program.

Recalling Some Useful Facts
  Program: sequence of compiler directives, declarations, instructions
  Normally, computer(Dumbo) executes instructions
    in same order in which they appear in program
	top to bottom, left to right, separated by ";"


A Simple Problem
  Divide integer A by integer B and output the quotient Q
  // do we really want to divide if B is 0?
  
  int main() {
      int A,B,Q;
	  cout &lt;&lt; "Give A and B" &lt;&lt; endl;
	  cin >> A >> B;
	  Q = A/B;
	  cout &lt;&lt; "Quotient is: " &lt;&lt; Q &lt;&lt; endl;
	  return 0;
  }
  
  // No because the output will not include any remainder values
  Do we want to divide if B is zero? If we want to not divide if the B is zero then we need to reformulate or rearticulate our problem in the following manner by saying that divide A by B and output the quotient Q if B and output the quotient Q if B is non-zero. Otherwise, that is if B is zero, we can simply output the string "Bad inputs" because then the division would lead to dividing A by 0, which is not very well defined operation.
  Key issue: Dividing A by 0
  
  We need conditional execution of (blocks of) instructions
    Read inputs A and B                 //Unconditionally execute first
	Divide A by B and output quotient Q //Execute next only if B is non-0
	Output the string "Bad inputs"
	Return control to caller/OS         //Unconditionally execute last

  if B is non-zero                      //since B is non-zero
    Read inputs A and B                 //Unconditionally execute first 
	Divide A by B and output quotient Q //Execute next since B is non-0
	//Output the string "Bad inputs"    --gets skipped
	Return control to caller/OS         //Unconditionally execute last



  Flowchart Representation
    Visually appealing representation of control flow in a progam
	read inputs A and B
	Check: Is B zero? Branch: Yes/No (Conditional flow of control) Block of instructions
	

  Conditional Execution in C++
    Computer Directives
	Variable Declarations
	Output
	Input
    "if ...else ..." statement
	  if(B==0) {
	    cout &lt;&lt; "Bad inputs!" &lt;&lt; endl;
	  }
	  else {
	    quotient = A/B;
		cout &lt;&lt; "Quotient is:" &lt;&lt; quotient &lt;&lt; endl; 
	  }
	Return statement


  Blocks in an "if ... else..." statement
  Blocks can be any sequence of C++ statements
  Specifically, can be another "if ... else ..." statement
    if(B==0){
	  cout &lt;&lt; "Bad input!" &lt;&lt; endl;
	}
	else {
	  if (B==1){cout &lt;&lt; "Are you joking?" &lt;&lt; endl;}
		else{quotient = A/B;cout &lt;&lt; "Quotient is:" &lt;&lt; quotient &lt;&lt; endl;}
	  }
	  
  "if ..." Without "else ..."
  "else ..." is optional in C++
    if (B==0) {... } equivalent to
	if (B==0) {... } else {//Do Nothing}
  Succinct way to write programs when nothing needs to be done in "else" branch
  

summary,
looked at conditional execution of statements in C++ programs.
looked at if else statement and its usage.
looked at nesting of if else statements.
looked at an example program with conditional execution to see how if else statements works.

}


  What if we want the same expression to take the value of (a+b)*c if (c&lt;= 0) and (a+b)/c otherwise?
  easy solution:
    if(c&lt;=0) {expr=(a+b)*c;}
    else {expr=(a+b)/c;}
  alternative solution:
    expr = (c&lt;=0)?(a+b)*c:(a+b)/c; //conditional expression
  //conditional expression: general form
    (logical expression)?(if-expression):(else-expression)

<pre>Example with Sequential and Conditional Execution
Overview: Example C++ program that uses most of the features of C++ programs that we have learned so far.

So this program is going to take date and time as integer inputs in this format, the date as date, month, year format and the time as hour, minute format. It will first do a check for invalid date and time. If the inputs are valid, if the input date and time are valid it will output one of these three messages - "Good morning", "Good afternoon" or "Good evening", depending on the time of the day. And after that it is going to print one of the three predetermined fortune messages. So we want to write a C++ program using whatever we have studied so far that has this functionality


summary, we were able
to write a simple yet interesting program that used integer variables,
assignment statement with arithmetic expressions,
logical expressions were used in the conditions of "if" statements.
We sequentially executed the different statements in the program.
We also used conditional execution using both "if else" and switch case constructs and for "if else"
we saw nested "if else" statements.
we saw the use of cin and cout for reading inputs from the keyboard and printing output back on to the screen.

<pre>Q1
Which of the following pairs will indicate the same boolean value?
Choices:
0,1
false, 0
true, false
None of the choices

myguess: false, 0
solution: false, 0
EXPLANATION
All non-0 values are true. 
Option A: 0, 1: 0 is false while 1 is true. Hence, option A is incorrect. 
Option B: false, 0: 0 is false. Hence (false, false) are same boolean values. Hence, option B is correct 
Option C: true, false. These represent different boolean values. Hence, option C is incorrect. 
Option D: Since, B is correct, option D is incorrect.



Q2
Following names are chosen by a programmer for using them as variable names. Which of these is an illegal choice?

Myname_123
case
Value_of_Pi_correct_upto_7_decimal_digits
do_while

/*
cannot start with 0-9: 1myVar
Cannot be c++ keyword: case is a keyword but do_while is not
Can start with _ or any letter from A to Z, a to z
Can be any length
*/

myguess: case
solution: case
EXPLANATION
’case’ is a keyword, and hence, it is invalid to use it as a variable name. All the other names are valid and can be used. Thus, the correct option is B.



Q3
What will be the number printed when cout &lt;&lt; a - b is executed?

#include&lt;iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
   int a = 020;
   float b = 10.5;
   cout &lt;&lt; a - b &lt;&lt; endl;
   return 0;
}

9.5
5.5
4.5
None of the choices

myguess: 5.5
solution: 5.5
EXPLANATION
int a=020 is NOT a decimal number. Starting a number with 0 indicates that it is an octal number.
(020)sub8 = (16)sub10.
Hence, 16 - 10.5 = 5.5



Q4
Assume that a, b, c, val1, val2, and val3 are integer variables. val1, val2, and val3 are computed as shown below. What will be output of the following program snippet given.

   int a = 0, b = 1, c = 0, val1, val2, val3;
   val1 = !(a || b || c);
   val2 = a || b && c ;
   val3 = !(a && b || c) ;
   cout &lt;&lt; val1 &lt;&lt; val2 &lt;&lt; val3;

myguess: None of the choices
solution: 001
EXPLANATION
The values are: a = 0, b = 1, c = 0
           Expressions                   Will Evaluate to
val1 = !(a || b || c);        !(0 || 1 || 0) = !(1) = 0
val2 =   a || b && c ;          0 || 1 && 0         = 0
val3 = !(a && b || c);        !(0 && 1 || 0) = !(0) = 1
So, 001 will be printed. Thus, the option B is correct



Q5
Consider the following C++ program.
#include&lt;iostream>
using namespace std ;
int main () {
   int n ;
   cout &lt;&lt; " Give n : " ;
   cin >> n ;
   if ( n &lt; 0) {
      switch ( n ) {
         case 0:
            cout &lt;&lt; " so " ;
         case -1: 
            cout &lt;&lt; " how is your " ;
         case -10: 
            cout &lt;&lt; " parrot 's " ;
         break ;
         default : 
            cout &lt;&lt; " cat 's " ;
      }
      cout &lt;&lt; " health ? " ;
   }
   else {
      switch ( n ) {
         case 0: 
            cout &lt;&lt; " so " ;
         case 1: 
            cout &lt;&lt; " how is your " ;
         case 10: 
            cout &lt;&lt; " cat 's " ;
         default : 
            cout &lt;&lt; " health ? " ;
      }
   }
   cout &lt;&lt; endl ;
   return 0;
}

Which of the following strings CANNOT be printed by the above program for any value of the input 'n' ?
Choices:
how is your parrot's health?
so how is your cat's health?
so how is your health?
parrot’s health?
None of the choices

my guess: so how is your health?
solution: so how is your health?
EXPLANATION

Option A is printed if the number n is -1 
Option B is printed if the number 'n' is 0. Note that in this case, the condition in the 'if' statement is not satisfied (since 0 is not &lt; 0), so the program enters the 'else' block.
Option C cannot be printed because in both the 'if' and 'else' blocks, there is no 'break' statement after printing ”how is your ”. Therefore, after printing ”how is your ” and before printing ”health?” either ”parrot’s ” or ”cat’s ” must be printed (fall-through in ’switch-case’ statement without ’break’). Consequently, the string ”so how is your health?” cannot be printed. 
Option D can be printed if the number ’n’ is -10. This is easy to see. 
Option E Since C is the correct answer E cannot be the correct answer.

$ ./a.out
 Give n : 0
 so  how is your  cat 's  health ? 
$ ./a.out
 Give n : 1
 how is your  cat 's  health ? 
$ ./a.out
 Give n : -1
 how is your  parrot 's  health ? 
$ ./a.out
 Give n : -10
 parrot 's  health ? 
$ ./a.out
 Give n : 10
 cat 's  health ? 
$ ./a.out
 Give n : 20
 health ? 
$ ./a.out
 Give n : 5
 health ? 
$ ./a.out
 Give n : 10
 cat 's  health ? 
$ ./a.out
 Give n : -20
 cat 's  health ?


Q6
(1 point possible)
Consider the following code snippet. Assume that all necessary header files and statements are written, and the variables 'number1' and 'number2' are declared as integer variables.

     if(number1 >= 1)
          cout&lt;&lt;"Good ";

     if( (number1 == 1) && (number2 > 2) )
          cout&lt;&lt;"Morning ";

     if( (number1 &lt;= 1) && (number2 >= 2) )
          cout&lt;&lt;"Afternoon";

     if( (number1 > 1) && (number2 >2) )
          cout&lt;&lt;"Evening";

What would be the output of the code snippet given above, if the user entered integer value '1' for number1 and integer value '2' for number2
choice:
Good Morning
Good Afternoon
Good Evening
None of the choices

myguess: Good Afternoon
solution

EXPLANATION
The value of number1 is 1, so the first 'if' statement is always executed. Thus, 'Good ' is printed.

For the 2nd 'if' statement, the first condition is satisfied, but the second one is not. Hence, the overall condition of the 'if' statement is not satisfied. The control goes to the next statement.

For the 3rd 'if' statement, both the conditions are satisfied, and hence, 'Afternoon' is printed.

For the 4th 'if' statement, both the conditons are not satisfied, and hence, the control goes to the next satement.

Thus, the final output is: Good Afternoon. Hence, option B is correct.

<pre>Q1
Which of the following given below will be ignored (not executed) by the C++ compiler?
choices
A
cout &lt;&lt; "Hello world";
B
c = a + b;
C
//This is a Hello world! program in C++
D
None of the choices

myguess: //This is a Hello world! program in C++
EXPLANATION

Option A: cout &lt;&lt; "Hello world"; will print 'Hello world' on the screen. This statement is executed by the compiler 

Option B: c = a + b;. Assuming that the variables 'a', 'b', and 'c', have already been declared in the program, this statement will add the values of variables 'a' and 'b', and will store the sum in variabe 'c'. This statement is executed by the compiler 

Option C: //This is a Hellow world! program in C++. This is a comment, which is noted by '//'. This statement will be ignored by the compiler and the control will go the next statement. Hence, option C is correct. 

Option D: Since option C is correct, this option is incorrect.

Q2
Identify the valid variable names from the following
I)    intHeight
II)   boolIsTrue
III)  2values
IV)   continue
V)    intWidth?
VI)   intPerimeter
VII)  floatSquareRoot
VIII) double_Square_root

A
I, II, III, and IV are valid 
B
I, II, VI, VII, and VIII are valid
C
III, IV, V, and VI are valid
D
V, VI, VII, and VIII are valid
E
None of the choices

myguess:  B: I, II, VI, VII, and VIII are valid
Solution: B
EXPLANATION
I.    intHeight: Valid
II.   boolIsTrue: Valid
III.  2values: Invalid, a variable name cannot begin with a number
IV.   continue: Invalid, as continue is a keyword/reserve word
V.    intWidth?: Invalid, no special characters except underscore i.e. '_' are allowed
VI.   intPerimeter: Valid
VII.  floatSquareRoot: Valid
VIII. double_Square_Root : Valid
Hence, the correct option is B. All other options are invalid.

,

Q3
What will be the number printed when cout &lt;&lt; a + b is executed?
#include&lt;iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
   int a=0x50;
   float b=7.4;
   cout &lt;&lt; a + b &lt;&lt; endl;
   return 0;
}
57.4
103.4
87.4
None of the choices

myguess: 87.4
solution:
0x50 = 80

80 + 7.4 = 87.4
EXPLANATION
int a = 0x50 is NOT a decimal number. Starting a number with 0x indicates that it is a hexadecimal number.
(0x50)16 = (80)10. 
Hence, 80 + 7.4 = 87.4

,

Q4
As per the code snippet given below, the integer variables val1, val2, and val3 are computed. What will be output of the following program snippet given.
    
   int a = 1, b = 0, c = 1, val1, val2, val3;
   val1 = a && !(b && c);                             (1) AND (NOT(0 AND 1))
   val2 = !(a && b) || c ;                            NOT(1 And 0) OR (1)
   val3 = a && !(b || c) ;                            (1) AND (Not
   cout &lt;&lt; val1 &lt;&lt; val2 &lt;&lt; val3 ;

None of the choices

myguess: 110
solution: 110

EXPLANATION

The values are: a = 1, b = 0, c = 1

             Expressions                            Will Evaluate to
val1 = a && !(b && c);      1 && !(0 && 1)  =  1 && !(0)  =  1 && 1  = 1
val2 = !(a && b) || c ;     !(1 && 0) || 1  =  !(0) || 1  =  1 || 1  = 1
val3 = a && !(b || c) ;     1 && !(0 || 1)  =  1 && !(1)  =  1 && 0  = 0

Q5
Consider the following 2 code snippets.

Code Snippet 1
    
   switch ( weather ) {
      case 1:
         cout &lt;&lt;" Grilled " ;
      break ;
      case 3:
         cout &lt;&lt;" Freezed " ;
      break ;
      default :
         cout &lt;&lt;" Room Temperature " ;
   }

Code Snippet 2
    
   if ( weather &lt;= 1) {
      cout &lt;&lt;" Grilled " ;
   } 
   else if ( weather >= 3) {
      cout &lt;&lt; " Freezed " ;
   }
   else {
      cout &lt;&lt;" Room Temperature " ;
   }

Which of the following is true for the code snippets given above

A) For all values of the variable 'weather', both the code snippets will give the same output
B) For all values of the variable 'weather', both the code snippets will give different output
C) For only some values of variable 'weather', both the code snippets will give same output
D) None of the choices

myguess: for only some values of variable "weather", both the code snippets will give same output

solution: for only some values of variable "weather", both the code snippets will give same output

EXPLANATION

Code Snippet 1: If the value of variable 'weather' is 1, 'Grilled' will be printed; if it is 3, then 'Freezed' will be printed. for any other value apart from 1 and 3, the first code snippet will print 'Room Temperature' 

Code Snippet 2: If the value of variable 'weather' is less than or equal to 1, then 'Grilled' will be printed; if it is greater than or equal to 3, 'Freezed' will be printed. Only when the value of variable 'weather' is 2, the code snippet 2 will print 'Room Temperature'.
This is summarized in the table given below:


Values      Output by Code Snippet 1       Output by Code Snippet 2         Comments
-n to 0         Room Temperature              Grilled                     Did not match
   1            Grilled                       Grilled                     Matched
   2            Room Temperature              Room Temperture             Matched
   3            Freezed                       Freezed                     Matched
4 to n          Room Temperature              Freezed                     Did not match

Thus, the option C is correct, as only for some values (1, 2, and 3), both the code snippets will give the same output.

,

Q6
Consider the following code snippet.

    
int main(){

   int number1=1, number2;
   cin >> number2;
   switch (number1) {
      case 1:  
         cout &lt;&lt;" Happy ";
      case 2:
         if (number2 &lt; 0 )
            cout &lt;&lt; " Holidays ";
         if (number2 > 10 && (number2 % 3 == 0) )
            cout &lt;&lt; "Birthday ";
         if (number2 > 5 && (number2 % 2 == 0) )
            cout &lt;&lt;"to you ";
      break;
      case 3:
         cout &lt;&lt; "Ending ";
      break;
      default:
         cout &lt;&lt; " Good luck next time! ";
   }
   return 0;
}

The value of variable 'number1' is 1. If the program is executed for the values of number2 from 10 to 30, how many times, the statement "Happy Birthday to you" will NOT be printed?

16
17
15
None of the choices

myguess:  17
solution: 17
EXPLANATION

The value of number1 is always 1. Since, there is no 'break' statement after case 1, after executing case 1, case 2 will also get executed. The following will be printed for values of number2 from 10 to 30.

        
Value of number2          Output                   Count to keep a track

      21               Happy Birthday                   10
      22               Happy  to you                    11
      23               Happy                            12
      24               Happy Birthday  to you           ---
      25               Happy                            13
      26               Happy  to you                    14
      27               Happy Birthday                   15
      28               Happy  to you                    16
      29               Happy                            17
      30               Happy Birthday  to you           ---
    
From the table given above, we can easily count the number of times "Happy Birthday to you" is not printed. The answer is 17. Thus, option B is correct.

Simple Problem
  Read quiz 1 marks of ten cs101 students,
  print their sum,
  average,
  maximum,
  minimum.
  
  Can the problem be solved with:
    assignment statements,
    I/O statements,
    arithmetic expressions,
    sequential and condition execution of statements.
  
  Overall Strategy:
    Maintain "running" sum, max, min(aggregates)
    Initialize aggregates
	Read input 1 and update aggregates
	Read input 2 and update aggregates
	 ...
	Read input 10 and update aggregates
	Compute average as sum/10
	Output sum, average, max, min

  C++ program translation
    int main(){
	  // Variable declaration
	  int marks, sum, min, max;
	  float average; //declare float datatype since average could have fractional parts
	  // initialization of aggregates
	  // variable declarations and initialization of sum and average
	  sum = 0; average = 0;
	  // Read marks of student 1, and update aggregates
	  cout &lt;&lt; "Give quiz marks of student 1: ";
	  cin >> marks;
	  sum = sum + marks;
	  // Initialize min and max with first input
	  min = marks; max = marks;
	  
	  cout &lt;&lt; "Give quiz marks of student 2: ";
	  cin >> marks;
	  sum = sum + marks;
	  min = (min > marks)? marks: min;
	  max = (max &lt; marks)? marks: max;
	  
	  
	  // Further code comes here
	  return 0;
	}
	
	intmain() {
	// Variable declarations and initialization of sum and average
	// Read marks of students1, 2 … 10, and update aggregates
	// Calculate and print aggregates
	average = sum/10.0;
	cout&lt;&lt; "Average: " &lt;&lt; average &lt;&lt; "Sum: " &lt;&lt; sum;
	cout&lt;&lt; "Min: “ &lt;&lt; min &lt;&lt; "Max: " &lt;&lt; max &lt;&lt; endl;
	return 0;
	}
	
	Some Observations
	(Almost) same instructions repeated multiple times
	cout&lt;&lt; "Give marks of student 3: ";
	cin>> marks;
	sum = sum + marks;
	min = (min > marks) ? marks : min;
	max=(max&lt;marks)?marks:max;

	Intuitively, we would like to execute (almost) the same instructions for all students
	
	Another Attempt At Our C++ Program
	intmain() {
	  // Variable declarations and initialization of aggregates
	  intcount = 1;
	  // Repeat the following block of code 10 times
	  { cout&lt;&lt; “Give marks of student “ &lt;&lt; count &lt;&lt; ": ";
	  cin>> marks;
	  sum = sum + marks;
	  // Update min and max appropriately
	  count = count + 1;
	  } // End of block of code to be repeated
	  // Code for computing average and printing comes here
	  return 0;
	}


    Another Attempt At Our C++ Program
    intmain() {
      // Variable declarations and initialization of aggregates
      intcount = 1;
      // Repeat the following block of code 10 times
      { cout&lt;&lt; “Give marks of student “ &lt;&lt; count &lt;&lt; “: “;
      cin>> marks;
      sum = sum + marks;
      if (count == 1) { min = marks; max = marks; }
      else { min = (min > marks) ? marks:min; max = (max &lt; marks) ? marks: max; }
      count = count + 1; // incrementing count
      } // End of block of code to be repeated
      // Code for computing average and printing comes here
    return 0;
    }
    // compared to our earlier program, this one is less repetitive and close to intuition
	// Yet in this case, the original problem could have been solved, and we have just seen how we could solve it, without the repetition construct or the iteration construct. Which means that in this case the repetition construct is handy, it gives us convenience, it allows us to write the program closer to our intuition, but it is not absolutely necessary.
	
So as a general rule of thumb, we should reuse as much code as possible, avoid repetitions
consciously and the iteration construct in a programming language allows us to do this

More General Iteration
  intnumStudents, count;
  cout&lt;&lt; "Give number of students in CS101: "; cin>> numStudents
  count = 1;
  // Repeat the following block of code while (count &lt;= numStudents)
  { cout&lt;&lt; "Give marks of student " &lt;&lt; count &lt;&lt; “: “;
  cin>> marks;
  sum = sum + marks;
  if (count == 1) { min = marks; max = marks; }
  else { min = (min > marks) ? marks:min; max = (max &lt; marks) ? marks: max; }
  count = count + 1;
  } // End of block of code to be repeated
  // Code to compute aggregates and print them
  
  C++ Iteration Constructs
  Several iteration constructs in C++:
    while (loopCondition) { Block of Statements to Iterate Over };
    do { Block of Statements to Iterate Over} while(loopCondition);
    for (initializationCode; loopCondition; CodeToExecuteAfterEachIteration)
  { Block of Statements to Iterate Over };


summary, we looked at iteration idioms in programming.
they are necessary in general
they are certainly convenient when we are writing code according to our intuition.
They enable code reuse,
allowing us to avoid the mistakes of repetition,
the mistakes that can get introduced due to repetition.
We also got a glimpse of iteration constructs in C++.

Q1
How many times will the 'while' loop in the following code execute?

#include &lt;iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int a = 2;
    int b = 5;
    int expr_one, expr_two;

    expr_one = 5*a - 2*b;  
    expr_two = (4*a + 8*b) % (b-1); 

    while(expr_one = expr_two) {
        expr_one += 5;
        expr_two--;
    }
    return 0;
}
choices:
1
0
2
9
4
myguess:  0
solution: 0
EXPLANATION
The condition inside the 'while' loop uses an assignment operator '=' instead of the equality comparison operator '=='. However, since the value of 'expr_two' is 0, and it gets assigned to 'expr_one' (which too had a value of 0 before execution of 'while'), the condition evaluates to 'False' and the loop is never entered. Please note that this is an incorrect way of writing a condition in the 'if' statement, and should never be used this way.

Q2
What will be the output of the following program, when it is executed.
#include &lt;iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
   int FACT = 1;
   for(unsigned int i = 6; i >= 0; --i) {
      FACT *= i;
   }
   cout &lt;&lt; FACT &lt;&lt; endl;
   return 0;
}
choices:
1
720
0
Will result in an infinite loop


$ g++ pps03-set1-q2.cpp 
pps03-set1-q2.cpp:6:32: warning: comparison of unsigned expression >= 0 is always true [-Wtautological-compare]
    for (unsigned int i = 6; i >= 0; --i)
                             ~ ^  ~


myguess: will result in an infinite loop
solution: will result in an infinite loop
EXPLANATION

Ordinarily, because of the condition i >= 0, the loop will be executed successively for decreasing values of i, starting with 6, followed by 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 and 0. The values of FACT will successively be 6, 30, 120, 360, 720, 720, and 0. After this, 'i' is supposed to become -1, at which point the loop should terminate.

Unfortunately, the declared type of 'i' is unsigned int. So 'i' can never become negative. When i is 0, and you subtract 1 from it, it actually becomes the largest possible positive value of unsigned int, because of modular arithmetic. Hence, the loop condition remains always true, and we never exit the loop.

The main correction needed in this program, is to change the condition from i >= 0 to i > 0, or even i > 1. The type can then be either int or unsigned int.

Q3
The program given below prints a pattern on 'n' number of lines. The pattern comprises of characters '+' and '*'. What pattern will be printed as output on the third line ?

      int j = 0;
      while(j++ &lt; 2*i) {
         cout &lt;&lt; "+";

EXPLANATION

Each outer iteration prints one *, followed by a number of + symbols printed by the inner while loop, followed again by a *. The third line will be printed when i = 2 in the outer iteration. The while condition at this point will be 'j++ &lt; 4'. This iteration will be executed 4 times, for j =0, 1, 2, and 3, printing + symbol 4 times.

The patterns that is printed after the entire program executes is :

myguess:  4342341
solution: 4342341

EXPLANATION

When 'switch-case' is used, after every 'case', 'break' statement needs to be written. If we do not use 'break' statement for every case, the program control will simply fall through to the next case i.e. it will execute all the cases, till a 'break' statement is encountered.

                               'break' statement is encountered, 
                               which exits from 'switch', and 
                               the control again goes to

<pre>PPS 03 - Set II
Q1
Consider the following program given below.
    
#include&lt;iostream>
using namespace std;

int main () {
    int m, n, temp;
    cout &lt;&lt; " Give integers m and n : " ;
    cin >> m >> n ;
    do{
        if ( m &lt; n) 
            n = n - m;
        if (n &lt; m) { 
            temp = m; 
            m = n; 
            n = temp;
        }
        if(m > n) 
            cout &lt;&lt; "!";
    } 
    while (m &lt; n);
    return 0;
}
Suppose we compile and run this program. Which of the following is true for the number of "!"s printed by the program?

For some values of 'm' and 'n', exactly one "!" is printed.
For all values of 'm' and 'n', no "!" is printed.
For all values of 'm' and 'n', the number of "!"s printed is either 1 or a positive even number.
For all values of 'm' and 'n', the number of "!"s printed is a positive odd number.
None of the above

myguess:  for all values of 'm' and 'n', no "!" is printed.
solution: for all values of 'm' and 'n', no "!" is printed.

EXPLANATION

Let us focus on the second 'if' statement in the body of the 'do ... while' statement.
Prior to executing this statement,
we could have one of three cases: 'm == n', 'm &lt; n' or 'm > n'.
In the first and second cases,
the condition of the second 'if' statement evaluates to false and
therefore either 'm == n' or 'm &lt; n' continues to hold even after executing the second 'if' statement.
If 'm > n' before executing the second 'if' statement,
the values of 'm' and 'n' are swapped,
and therefore the (new) value of 'm' is less than the (new) value of 'n' after
executing this 'if' statement. Therefore, in all the cases, the value of 'm',
after executing the second 'if' statement, is less than or equal to the value of 'n'.
Therefore, the condition of the 'if' statement 'if (m > n) cout &lt;&lt; "!"'
never evaluates to true, and so no "!" is ever printed.

Q2
Consider the program given below:

    
#include&lt;iostream>
using namespace std;
int main () {
   int a, b;
   do {
      cout &lt;&lt; " Enter a : " ;
      cin >> a ;
      cout &lt;&lt; " Enter b : " ;
      cin >> b ;
   } while ( a &lt; 10 || b > 10) ;
   return 0;
}


Which of the folowing is a VALID statement:

The program will always terminate for all values of input 'a' greater than 9, 
irrespective of the value of input 'b'

The program will always terminate for all values of input 'b' lesser than 11, irrespective of the value of input 'a'

For all values of input 'a' greater than 9 and input 'b' lesser than 11, the program is guaranteed to terminate

None of these

Q3
(1 point possible)
Consider the program given below

    
#include &lt;iostream>
using namespace std;
int main () {
   int num1 = 4;
   int counter = 0;
   for ( counter = 0; counter &lt;= 4; counter+=2) {
      switch ( counter ) {
         case 1:
            num1++;
         break;
         case 2:
            num1+=2;
         case 4:
            num1%=2;
            counter = -1;
         continue;
         default :
            --num1;
         continue;
      }
   }
   return 0;
}

  
Which of the folowing is an INVALID statement:

The default case is executed twice, whereas, Case 1 and Case 2 are executed exactly once

Case 4 is executed exactly twice, i.e. once immediately after executing Case 2 and other, immediately after the counter is incremented by 2 in the for loop

After the end of the for loop (i.e. before the statement return 0;), if we add a statement 'cout &lt;&lt; counter-num1;' in the above code, then the value displayed will be 4

None of these

,

Q4
(1 point possible)
Consider the program given below

    
#include &lt;iostream>
using namespace std;
int main () {
   int a, b, c, num1, num2;
   cout &lt;&lt; "Enter two numbers" &lt;&lt; endl;
   cin >> num1 >> num2;
   if ( num1 > num2 ) {
      a = num1;
      b = num2;
   }
   else {
      a = num2;
      b = num1;
   }
   while ( St1 ) {
       St2 
      a = b;
      b = c;
   }
   return 0;
}

  
Select an appropriate choice from the following:

If we replace St1 with 'a!=0', St2 with 'c = b % a;', 
then the program will always compute the GCD of numbers 'num1' and 'num2' 
and store in variable 'b'.

If we replace St1 with 'b!=0', and St2 with 'c = a % b;', 
then the program will always compute the GCD of numbers 'num1' and 'num2' 
and store in variable 'a'.

If we replace St1 with 'b!=0', and St2 with 'c = a % b;',
then the program does not necessarily compute the GCD of numbers 'num1' and 'num2' 
and store in variable 'a'.

If we replace St1 with 'a!=0', and St2 with 'c = b % a;',
then the program will always compute the GCD of numbers 'num1' and 'num2' and store in variable 'a'.

,

Q5
(1 point possible)
Consider the program given below

    
#include &lt;iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
   int i, countIf = 0, countElse = 0;
   for ( i = 1; i &lt; 5; i++)
      if ( ( i * i * i + 2) > ( i * i + 3) )
         countIf++;
      else
         countElse++;
   cout &lt;&lt; countIf &lt;&lt; "," &lt;&lt; countElse;
   return 0;
}

  
What output would be displayedby the program given above.
4,1
3,1
4,2
3,2

myguess: 3,1
solution: 3,1
EXPLANATION
Let us denote i * i * i + 2 by H, and i * i + 3 by K.

i			H			K					'countIf' inremented 
only if H > K									'countElse' incremented 
only if H &lt;= K
1			3			4					0									1
2			10			7					1									1
3			29			12					2									1
4			66			19					3									1
From the table given above, we can see that, when variable 'i' is 1, the computation produced by first operand is not greater than the second operand, hence, the variable 'countElse' is incremented from 0 to 1. Thereafter, for every value of 'i' from 2 to 4, the first operand is greater than second. Hence, the value of variable 'countIf' is incremented 3 times i.e. 3. Thus, the output produced by the code segment is 3,1. Hence, option B is correct.

Find the sum of squares of individual digits of a number 'sqdnumber' and store the sum in variable 'sqdNumber_result'. E.g. if the number is 234, the sum is computed as (2**2 + 3**2 + 4**2 = 4 + 9 + 16 = 29)

<p>Practice Programming Assignment (PPA 03) > PPA3</p>
<pre>Practice Programming Assignment (PPA 03)
Happy Numbers: A number is called a happy number, if you repeat the process, of squaring the sum of the digits, till the value 1 is obtained. E.g. You need to do the following to perform this check: (a) compute the sum of the squares of its digits (b) if the resultant value is 1, then the number is a happy number, else execute point (a). If a number is not a happy number, there will be an endless loop/cycle to this execution. 

Task: In this programming assignment, you are required to write code that checks whether the number is a happy number or not, for 10 cycles (iterations) only. 2 examples of happy numbers (limited to 10 cycles ) are given below:

Example 1: Assume a number '19'

Number	Computation	     Result	 Cycle / Iteration
19 	    9^2 + 1^2	     82	     1
82	    2^2 + 8^2	     68	     2
68	    8^2 + 6^2	     100	 3
100	    0^2 + 0^2 + 1^2	 1	     4
Stop computing further, as the Result obtained is 1. Hence, the number '19', is a happy number. We achieved this in 4 cycles only.
 Example 2: Assume a number '3'

Number	Computation	     Result	Cycle
3	    3^2 	         9	    1
9	    9^2 	         81	    2
81	    1^2 + 8^2	     65	    3
65	    5^2 + 6^2	     61	    4
61	    1^2 + 6^2	     37	    5
37	    7^2 + 3^2	     58	    6
58	    8^2 + 5^2	     89	    7
89	    9^2 + 8^2	     145	8
145	    5^2 + 4^2 + 1^2	 42	    9
42	    2^2 + 4^2	     20	    10
Stop computing further, as we are allowed to compute for 10 cycles only. The resultant value after computing 10 cycles is 20
  You are required to do the following:

Find the sum of the digits of the number.
Check the result obtained in point 1. If it is 1, assign value 1 to the variable 'finalNumber', else again execute point 1, till the number obtained is 1 or till the number of cycle increases to 10.
Assign the iteration value to the variable 'cycle_no'.

Output A = 325
Output B = 269

What value will be printed by the statement 'Output A'. Write your numerical answer in the textbox given below. Please make sure that you do not enter any space in the textbox.
325
What value will be printed by the statement 'Output B'. Write your numerical answer in the textbox given below. Please make sure that you do not enter any space in the textbox.
269

EXPLANATION:
Mr. Dumbo assigns the values 56 and 213 to locations 'A' and 'B' respectively.

 No.     Statement        After execution of the statement
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  v.    B = A + B;       B = 56 + 213 = 269, 
                         i.e. 56 and 213 is added and the sum assigned to B
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 vi.    A = A + B;       A = 56 + 269 = 325, 
                         A is assigned as 325 by 
                         adding 56(the original value of A from iii) 
                         to the computed value of B (in the previous 
                         step, i.e. 269).

Magical Mary

 Magical Mary Williams Magical Mary Williams - correct  Magical Williams  Magical Kolkata  Magical Mary
Explanation:


number1 = 1
number2 = 1

The 1st If statement: 
	if( (number1 >= 0) && (number2 <= 1) )
		 The first conditon (number1 >= 0) is satisfied and 
		 The second condition (number2 <= 1) is also satisfied 
	Since both conditions are satisfied, the cout statement will be executed. 
	It will print Magical

The 2nd If statement: 
	if( (number1 >= 2) && (number2 > 2) )
		 The first conditon (number1 >= 2) is not satisfied
	To execute the cout statement, both conditions need to be satisfied. 
	Thus, the cout statement will not be executed.

The 3rd If statement: 
	if( (number1 <= 1) && (number2 >= 1) )
		 The first conditon (number1 <= 1) is satisfied and 
		 The second condition (number2 >= 1) is also satisfied 
	Since both conditions are satisfied, the cout statement will be executed. 
	It will print Mary

The 4th If statement: 
	if( (number1 > 0) && (number2 >= 1) )
		 The first conditon (number1 > 0) is satisfied and 
		 The second condition (number2 >= 1) is also satisfied 
	Since both conditions are satisfied, the cout statement will be executed. 
	It will print Williams

The 5th If statement: 
	if( (number1 == 3) && (number2 != 3) )
		 The first conditon (number1 == 3) is not satisfied
	To execute the cout statement, both conditions need to be satisfied. 
	Thus, the cout statement will not be executed.

Thus the output of this program is : 
Magical Mary Williams

=========Q6
Consider the program given below.

int main() { 
    int a = 8;
    int b = 8;
    int lamp, light;
 
    lamp = 5*a + 2*b;
    light = 4*a + 8*b;
 
    while(lamp &lt; light) {
        lamp = lamp + 4;
        light = light - 2;
    }
    return 0;
}

How many times does the while loop execute. Write your numerical answer in the textbox given below. Please make sure that you do not enter any space in the textbox.

7
EXPLANATION:

            
At first the value of variables lamp and light are computed based on the values of a and b: 
The dry run given below, shows the step by step execution, of the while loop

lamp = 56 and light = 96
is lamp &lt; light ? 	 lamp + 4 	 light - 2 	 count
       Yes    		    60 		   94 		   1
       Yes    		    64 		   92 		   2
       Yes    		    68 		   90 		   3
       Yes    		    72 		   88 		   4
       Yes    		    76 		   86 		   5
       Yes    		    80 		   84 		   6
       Yes    		    84 		   82 		   7

Now, since lamp is not less than light, the control exits the while loop. Based on the value of count, we can say that the loop executed 7 times.

        s2 = s1;
        for(j = 0; j &lt;= k; j++) {
            s2++;
        }
        s1 = s1 + 2;
        k = k + 1;
    }

    cout &lt;&lt; s2;    
    return 0;
}

What value will be printed by the statement 'cout &lt;&lt; s2;'.
Write your answer (character) in the textbox given below.
Please make sure that you do not enter any space in the textbox.

n
EXPLANATION
The following pattern is printed by the program 
de
fgh
hijk
jklmn
The dry run given below shows how the pattern is printed

i = 0,  j = 0,  k = 1,  s1 = c

 i 	 s2 = s1 	 j 	 s2++ 	 s1 + 2 	 k + 1 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
 0 	    c    	 0 	  d 	    
			 1 	  e 	    e   	    2
-----------------------------------------------------------------
 1 	    e    	 0 	  f 	    
			 1 	  g 	    
			 2 	  h 	    g   	    3
-----------------------------------------------------------------
 2 	    g    	 0 	  h 	    
			 1 	  i 	    
			 2 	  j 	    
			 3 	  k 	    i   	    4
-----------------------------------------------------------------
 3 	    i    	 0 	  j 	    
			 1 	  k 	    
			 2 	  l 	    
			 3 	  m 	    
			 4 	  n 	    k   	    5
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Thus, at this stage the value of s2 is n. This value is printed by the statement cout &lt;&lt; s2;    
=========Q8
Q8
Consider the program given below

int main () {
    int a = 3; 
    int num1, num2;
    num1 = 336;
    num2 = 27; 
    
    for ( ; ; ) {
       a = a * 3;
       if(a > num1) {
          a = a - 5; 
          break;
        }
    }

    while(true) {
        a = a / 2; 
        if(a &lt; num2) { 
            a = a - 5; 
            break;
        }
    }
    cout &lt;&lt; a;
    return 0;
} 

What value will be printed by the statement 'cout &lt;&lt; a;'. Write your numerical answer in the textbox given below. Please make sure that you do not enter any space in the textbox.


EXPLANATION

 Since no condition is given to execute the for loop, the control enters the for loop. It will execute till the value of a is greater than num1. If this never happens then the loop is an infinite loop. Given below is the dry run for the loop.

 Initial value of a is 3
num1 		 a * 3 		 is a > num1 		 a - 5
336 		  9 		     No     		  - 
336 		  27 		     No     		  - 
336 		  81 		     No     		  - 
336 		  243 		     No     		  - 
336 		  729 		    Yes    		 724

Now, the value of a is 724

We will now execute the while loop. Similar to the for loop, just executed, the while loop will execute infinitely, till the value of a is less than the value of num2. Given below is the dry run for the loop.

num2 		 a / 2 		 is a &lt; num2 		 a - 5
27 		  362 		     No      		   - 
27 		  181 		     No      		   - 
27 		  90 		     No      		   - 
27 		  45 		     No      		   - 
27 		  22 		    Yes    		  17

Thus, the final value of a is 17
=========Q9
Q9
Consider the program given below

#include&lt;iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int b, c, g, h, d;
    cout &lt;&lt; "Enter two numbers:";
    cin >> b >> c;
    g = b;
    h = c;
 
     while(STATEMENT 1){
        if(b > c) 
            STATEMENT 2
        else 
            c = c - b; 
    }
    STATEMENT 3
  
    return 0;
}     

Choose the correct option. 

If we replace STATEMENT 1 with b != c and 
STATEMENT 2 with b = b - c; and 
STATEMENT 3 with d = g * h / b; , 
then the program computes LCM of the two numbers (b and c) and stores the result in d  

If we replace STATEMENT 1 with g == c and 
STATEMENT 2 with h = d / c and 
STATEMENT 3 with d = b * h / b
then the program computes LCM of the two numbers (b and c) and stores the result in d 

If we replace STATEMENT 1 with c >= g and
STATEMENT 2 with b = g - b and
STATEMENT 3 with g = b * g / b
then the program computes LCM of the two numbers (b and c) and stores the result in d 

If we replace STATEMENT 1 with c == b and
STATEMENT 2 with h = c + d and
STATEMENT 3 with b = b * g / b
then the program computes LCM of the two numbers (b and c) and stores the result in d

FlipDigital: FlipDigital is a company that manufactures harddisks of various RPM (Revolutions Per Minute) to cater to the needs of all individuals. Usually, the life span of their harddisks is more than 10 years, i.e. It should work for atleast 10 years. Unfortunately, a serious bug was detected, due to which the RPM increases or decreases every year in the following manner: (a) multiply the number 323 to sum of the squares of the digits of the RPM,  (b) shift the digits of the RPM to the right by 1 position in a cyclic way, and finally (c) extract the last two digits of the new number obtained and add to the result obtained in 'a'. The final result (c) is the new RPM. 

This issue is that if the RPM increases by a certain limit, then the hard disk crashes, which is also dangerous to the person who is using it. The maximum limit of the RPM of the hard disk is 8 times of the RPM, i.e. if RPM of harddisk is 1000, then the maximum RPM can be 1000 * 8 = 8000. This issue needs to be resolved before they release the harddisks to the general public. We have been given a contract to find out (based on the RPM) which harddisks will last for more than 10 years, and which will not. 

Assume that the RPM is between 3524 and 8524 only, both inclusive.

Task:  You are required to write code that does the following:-

1) Find out the sum of the squares of the digits of the RPM
2) Multiply the number obtained in (1) by 323
3) Do a cyclic right shift of digits of the RPM i.e. if Number is 1234, after cyclic right shift, the number will be 4123. Thereafter, take the last two digits of the number obtained just now, and add it to the number obtained in point 2. Thus, obtaining a new RPM value.
4) Do these steps till the number of years are 10 or the harddisk has reached the maximum RPM
Example 1: Assume an RPM of 5524. So, the maximum limit of RPM is 5524 * 8 = 44192

RPM|Years|SSD|A SSD * 323|B Cyclic Right Shift|A + last 2 digits of B|Result(Next RPM)
5524	1 4^2 + 2^2 + 5^2 + 5^2
= 16 + 4 + 25 + 25	70 * 323
= 22610	4552	22610 + 52	22662
22662	2	22 + 62 + 62 + 22+ 22
= 4 + 36 + 36 + 4 + 4	84 * 323
= 27132	22266	27132 + 66	27198
27198	3	82 + 92 + 12 + 72 + 22
= 64 + 81 + 1 + 49 + 4	199 * 323
= 64277	82719	64277 + 19	64296
Stop computing further as the maximum limit of RPM is 44192, and the RPM after 3 years is 64296
Example 2: Assume an RPM of 7024. So, the maximum limit of RPM is 7024 * 8 = 56192

RPM	Years	   SSD	        A
SSD * 323	                B

22289	2	92 + 82 + 22 + 22 + 22

24229	5	92 + 22 + 22 + 42 + 22 
= 109
109 * 323
= 35207	92422	35207 + 22	35229
35229	6	92 + 22 + 22 + 52 + 32

39751	7	12 + 52 + 72 + 92 + 32

53370	8	02 + 72 + 32 + 32 + 52

29753	9	32 + 52 + 72 + 92 + 22 
= 168
168 * 323

54339	10	92 + 32 + 32 + 42 + 52 
= 140
140 * 323
= 45220	95433	45220 + 33	45253
Stop computing, as 10 years have passed and still the RPM has not exceeded the maximum limit.
You are required to do the following:

Find out the sum of the squares of the digits of the RPM
Multiply the number obtained in (1) by 323
Do a cyclic right shift of digits of the RPM and take the last two digits of the number obtained just now, and add it to the number obtained in point 2. Thus, obtaining a new RPM value.
Do these steps till the number of years are 10 or the harddisk has reached the maximum RPM
Finally assign the modified value i.e. the final of RPM to the variable 'finalRPM'
